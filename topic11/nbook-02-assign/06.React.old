# Hooking up the React App.

We will now connect your MovieDB React App to the API. This step requires completion of the React labs.

## System Architecture

We will keep using the **create-react-app** framework you were using previously. **create-react-app** provides a mechanism for working with an API server in development. We can have the development server proxy requests intended for our API server as follows:

![Development Architecture](./img/architecture.png)

The React app makes an API request to localhost:3000, the Webpack development server. The development server proxies that request to the API server. This will remove any Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) issues with the browser.
For this to work we need to launch both the create-react-app dev server and the API server in order to run the app locally. We also need to get the react dev server to proxy requests to the Express API.


+ Open a console window in the MovieDB React App folder and start the react app:

```
npm start
```

Check that the app functions as before. If it's not working then check the error messages if any.

## Set up

#### Proxy Server
To have the React development server proxy our API requests to our Express API server, we need to add the following to the **package.json file for the React Application**

```json
"proxy":"http://localhost:8080",
```

This should forward any request for unknown resources though to our Express app listening on port 8080.


### Start both apps
You will need to now start both the react app and the Express API at the same time. Open two separate command windows in the MovieDB folder and the parent lab folder. Start the respective servers in both windows:

```
npm start
```

You should see both processes come to life. As before, they support 'hot code changes' so you should not have to restart the processes as you make changes.

## Integrate the Express MovieDB API

Currently the MovieDB app uses */src/api/stubAPI.js* and *src/api/tmdb-api.js* to mimic a real API. We will now replace this with functionality that integrates the express API.  We also need to manage JWT tokens in local storage in the browser.

**IN THE REACT APP, DO THE FOLLOWING...**


+ Replace all code in  */src/api/tmdb-api.js* folder with the following code:

```javascript
export const getMovies = () => {
    return fetch(
       '/api/movies',{headers: {
         'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
      }
    }
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => {return json.results;});
  };
  
  export const getMovie = id => {
    return fetch(
      `/api/movies/${id}`,{headers: {
        'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
     }
    }
    ).then(res => res.json());
  };
  
  export const getGenres = () => {
    return fetch(
      `/api/genres`,{headers: {
        'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
     }
   }
  )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => json.genres);
  };

  export const getMovieReviews = id => {
    return fetch(
      `/api/movies/${id}/reviews`,
      {headers: {
        'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
     }
   }
  )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => json.results);
  };

  export const login = (username, password) => {
   return fetch('/api/users', {
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
      method: 'post',
      body:  JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
  };
  
  export const signup = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users?action=register',{
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
  };
```

Notice how the routes match what is implemented in the Express API **and** what was tested using postman. The proxy property in the React MovieDBs *package.json* provides the host information required to complete the request(i.e. localhast:8080). Also, an authorization header is added to some of the requests. This is for authentication functionality we will implement next.


+ You may have noticed the application in the browser is not working correctly - there's no movies and you might see the message below in the console.

~~~bash
proxy error: Could not proxy request /api/moviess from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:8080.
See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNREFUSED).
~~~

This is because the react app (the client) has not retrieved a valid JSON Web Token to use the MovieDB Express API.
In the next part, we will include a Login page to allow user authentication.
