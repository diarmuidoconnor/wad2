# Object Referencing

Now that we have the Movies collection in our database, we can update the favourites in the User schema to use reference documents directly in the movies Collection. We will use Mongoose object referencing to do this:

- Open */api/users/userModel.js* and delete the ``moviesSchema``  constant:  
![](./img/del.png)
- In the ``UserSchema`` constant declaration, replace the ``favourites:`` property with the following:  
```javascript
favourites: [{type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Movies'}]
```

Because we now have Mongoose static methods to find Users using the ``userName``(``findByUserName``) and Movies using ``id``(``findByMovieDBId``), we can rewrite/simplify the route to add favourites (Post /:userName/favourites).

- Open */api/users/index.js* and replace the code that handles the Post '/:userName/favourites' route with the following: 

~~~javascript
//Add a favourite. No Error Handling Yet. Can add duplicates too!
router.post('/:userName/favourites', async (req, res, next) => {
  const newFavourite = req.body.id;
  const userName = req.params.userName;
  const movie = await movieModel.findByMovieDBId(newFavourite);
  const user = await User.findByUserName(userName);
  await user.favourites.push(movie._id);
  await user.save(); 
  res.status(201).json(user); 
});
~~~

Test the new functions by adding a few favourites to the user *user1* as follows. **Remember, only a valid ``id`` property must be supplied in the POST body(no need for full movie details as shown in the follwoing image ):
