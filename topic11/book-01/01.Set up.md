# Starter React App

You will use a simple React App. You can get this application from the code archive in this topic on the website.

## Initial set up

This exercise assumes you have finished the last lab. **Make sure to commit your last lab changes to git before proceeding and continue with the same codebase.**

+ Download the React App from the React App code archive on the website.
+ Extract this application into your labs repository. This should create a *ReactApp* folder in your repository. DO NOT EXRACT THIS INTO *movies-api* FOLDER FOR YOUR OTHER LABS. 
+ Open a terminal Window in the *ReactApp* folder and run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start``. This should start the React app and you should see the App appear in the browser

In this application, the *Movies* and *Profile* routes are protected. If you click on the *movies* link you'll see that the Login Page is shown. Clicking on the "LogIn* button will Authenticate you and allow access to the protected groups.

Look at the code and notice that there is a *pages.js* that exports most of the  pages for the app and the *authcontext.js* that provides the authentication context for all pages. 


## Start the movie-api

+ Open another terminal window and start the movies API from last weeks lab by entering ``npm start``. This should start the API on localhost:8080. **Leave this running for the remainder of the lab**
