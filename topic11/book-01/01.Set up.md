# Starter React App

You will use a simple React App. You can get this application from the Resources archive in this topic on the website.

## Initial set up

This exercise assumes you have finished the last lab. **Make sure to commit your last lab changes to git before proceeding.**

+ Download the React App archive from the Resources link on the website.
+ Extract the archive into the root of your ***wad-api-labs-2021*** repository .  **DO NOT EXTRACT THIS INTO *movies-api* FOLDER YOU ARE USING FOR YOUR OTHER LABS.** It should extract into a reactApp folder with the following contents:  
![reactApp folder contents](./img/7.png)

+ Open a terminal Window in the *reactApp* folder and run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start``. This should start the React app and you should see the App appear in the browser

In this application, everything is accessible. click on the *Movies* and *Profile* routes and you'll see that you can access the respective pages.

Look at the code and notice that there is a *pages.js* that exports most of the  pages for the app.


## Start the movie-api

+ Open another terminal window and start the movies API from last weeks lab by entering ``npm start``. This should start the API on localhost:8080. **Leave this running for the remainder of the lab**
