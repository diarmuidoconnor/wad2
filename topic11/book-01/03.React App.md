# The React App

We will now connect theReact App to the movie API. 

## System Architecture

We are using the **create-react-app** framework. **create-react-app** provides a mechanism for working with an API server in development. We can make the development server proxy requests intended for our API server as follows:

![Development Architecture](./img/2.png)

The React app makes an API request to localhost:3000, the **Webpack** development server. The development server then proxies that request to the API server. This will remove any Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) issues with the browser.
You will now configure react dev server to proxy requests to the Express API.

## Set up

#### Proxy Server
To have the React development server proxy our API requests to our Express API server, we need to add the following to the **package.json file for the React Application**

+ In the *ReactApp* folder, open *package.json* and add the following property just before the closing brace (``}``): 

```json
"proxy":"http://localhost:8080",
```

Make sure the format of the *package.json* is correct/valid before you try to start the app.

This should now forward any request for unknown resources to the Express API listening on port 8080.

+ **You now need to RESTART THE REACT APP**.

## Integrating the Express MovieDB API

Currently the simple React app uses no API to authenticate or retrieve movies. You will now add the functionality that integrates the express API.  You also need to manage JWT tokens in local storage in the browser.

Initially, we will integrate the authentication functionality.

**IN THE REACT APP, DO THE FOLLOWING...**


+ Go to the */src * folder and create a new folder called *api*
+ In  */src/api/*, create a new file called *movie-api.js* with the following code:

```javascript
export const login = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users', {
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
       method: 'post',
       body:  JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
     }).then(res => res.json())
   };
 
   export const signup = (username, password) => {
     return fetch('/api/users?action=register',{
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
       },
       method: 'post',
       body: JSON.stringify({username: username, password: password })
     }).then(res => res.json())
   };
```

Notice how the routes match what is implemented in the Express API **and** what you tested using postman. The proxy property in the React *package.json* provides the host information required to complete the request(i.e. localhast:8080).
