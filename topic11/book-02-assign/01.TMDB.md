# Assignment Planning/Ideas...

You should have a functional API from the work you did in the labs. 

## TMDB

See [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for details of the TMDB API. 
This is a very rich API and you can use this to get ideas for extra functionality to add to your API. 
**NOTE: while you will integrate with a React App, in order to address some of the grading spectrum you can develop API functionality that may not be used by the React App.**

## Discover

- You could update the */api/movies* route to support queries(in the query string) and use Mongoose to accomplish this on the DB

## Movies

Many different routes are implementable. For example, you could extend the Movies schema to include reviews(and each review could reference the user who made them). You could implement a ``/api/movies/[:movieId]/reviews`` route.
