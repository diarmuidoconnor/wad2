# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we will complete the Movies Fan app. 

The only remaining feature is to enable the user write their own review of a favorite movie. Also, known bugs identified in the previous lab will be fixed. 

The new React features used in this development iteration include:

+ The Render props pattern.
+ The Context API.
+ 3rd party hooks, e.g. useForm.
