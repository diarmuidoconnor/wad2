## Global Data and Contexts.

A common feature of React apps is where many components need to access the same piece of data. For example, many components may need to know the identity of the currently authenticated user. However, this situation can lead to 'prop drilling', where components in the middle of the component hierarchy must pass props from a high-level component to low-level components - the middle-tier components may not use the props themselves. React provides __Contexts__ to solve this problem - it is an implementation of the generic Provider design pattern. We will use a Context to store information about movies tagged as favourites. The Home page and Favourites page will use the Context as both use this data.

Create the file `src/contexts/moviesContext.js` and add this code:

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

export const MoviesContext = React.createContext(null);

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [favourites, setFavourites] = useState( [] )

  const addToFavourites = (movie) => {
    let newFavourites = [...favourites];
    if (!favourites.includes(movie.id)) {
      newFavourites.push(movie.id);
    }
    setFavourites(newFavourites);
  };
  
  // We will use this function in a later section
  const removeFromFavourites = (movie) => {
    setFavourites( favourites.filter(
      (mId) => mId !== movie.id
    ) )
  };

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        favourites,
        addToFavourites,
        removeFromFavourites
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
```
Note, we are storing only the selected movie's id in the favourites array above. At one level, the MoviesContextProvider component is not exceptional - it simply manages the list of favourites. The intention is to compose it with other components using the Container pattern - _props.children_. A distinguishing feature of MoviesContextProvider is it operates as a _context provider_, due to the _MoviesContext.Provider_ wrapper. This will gives other components direct access to the favourite movies state array (and the two functions that manipulate it) without the need for prop drilling.

In `src/index.js`, make these changes:

- add an import:

```
import MoviesContextProvider from "./contexts/moviesContext";
```

- modify the App component:

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <SiteHeader />
        <MoviesContextProvider>
            <Routes>
              ..... as before .....
            </Routes>
        </MoviesContextProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
      <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};

const rootElement = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
rootElement.render(<App />);
```
The App component _composes_ the MoviesContextProvider with the rest of our components. All components can potentially access the _values_ in the context, subject to a small code addition. For example, the Home page and Favourites page will be able to access the favourites list. 

We can now dispense with using the browser's local storage for storing information about favourite movies. In `components/movieCard/index.js`, make these changes:
~~~js
import React, { useContext  } from "react";
..... other imports .....
import { MoviesContext } from "../../contexts/moviesContext";

..... other (styling) code .....

export default function MovieCard({ movie }) {
 const { favourites, addToFavourites } = useContext(MoviesContext);

  if (favourites.find((id) => id === movie.id)) {
    movie.favourite = true;
  } else {
    movie.favourite = false
  }

  const handleAddToFavourite = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    addToFavourites(movie);
  };

  return (
     .... as before ....
  );
}
~~~
The useContext hook allows a component to _consume_ the values exposed by a context provider, e.g. the addToFavourites function and favourites array. 

We decided to store movie ids only in the favourites array. The Favourite movies page can use these ids to fetch the movie details from TMDB - alternatively, we could have excavated them from the cache, but this is somewhat unorthodox.

React-query supports __parallel queries__, which we can utilize here. In `pages/favouriteMoviesPage.js`, completely replace the code with the following:
```js
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import { MoviesContext } from "../contexts/moviesContext";
import { useQueries } from "react-query";
import { getMovie } from "../api/tmdb-api";
import Spinner from '../components/spinner'

const FavouriteMoviesPage = () => {
  const {favourites: movieIds } = useContext(MoviesContext);

  // Create an array of queries and run in parallel.
  const favouriteMovieQueries = useQueries(
    movieIds.map((movieId) => {
      return {
        queryKey: ["movie", { id: movieId }],
        queryFn: getMovie,
      };
    })
  );
  // Check if any of the parallel queries is still loading.
  const isLoading = favouriteMovieQueries.find((m) => m.isLoading === true);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Spinner />;
  }

  const movies = favouriteMovieQueries.map((q) => {
    q.data.genre_ids = q.data.genres.map(g => g.id)
    return q.data
  });

  const toDo = () => true;

  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="Favourite Movies"
      movies={movies}
      selectFavourite={toDo}
    />
  );
};

export default FavouriteMoviesPage;
```

In the browser, try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favorites' icon of the first three movies - they each have a favourite icon coloured red in the title.
1. Navigate to the Favorites page. It's showing the tagged movies.
1. Navigate back to the Home page. The three movies are still tagged as favourites. 

Update the git repository as follows:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor: Favourite movie list now stored in a context."
$ git push origin master

```
