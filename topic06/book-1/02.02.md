# Github

The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on.

## Create a GitHub Account
GitHub is a website that allows people everywhere to upload what they're working on with Git and to easily work together.

Visit [github.com](http://github.com) and sign up for a free account.

## Add username to Git

Add your GitHub username to your Git configuration, which will be needed in order to push the upcoming labwork to Github. Save it exactly as you created it on GitHub â€” capitalise where capitalised, and remember you don't need to enter the "<" and ">" .

Add your GitHub username to your configuration:

~~~bash
$ git config --global user.username <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>
~~~

## Remote Repository

When you put files on GitHub, that copy lives on one of GitHub's servers. This makes it a *remote* repository because it is not on your computer. You need to *push* your local (on your computer) changes to it, you keep it up to date.

Others can always get the latest from your project by pulling your changes down from the remote (and onto their computer). In fact, this is how you will get the weekly updates to the code examples repo. It is also how you can collaborate with others.

### Create a Remote Repository

You want to sync your local version with one stored on GitHub.com called the *remote* version. So first create an empty remote repository on GitHub.com.

Go to github.com, log in, and click the '+' in the top right to create a new repository.
Give it a name that matches your local repository's name, ***ewd-node-labs-2019***, and a short description.
Select the following options:

- make it public or private as you see fit.
- **don't** create a readme.md (you have one already in your local repo).
- create a .gitignore and select the *Node* option in the dropdown.
Click create repository and you should be taken to your new repo page. 
- Copy the URL from the "clone or download" option on the repo page.  You will need the URL of the repo to connect your local repo to this *remote* repo.

### Connect your Local to your Remote

Now you've got a remote repository on GitHub.com, back in your terminal in 'ewd-node-labs-2019' folder, you want to tell Git the location of the remote version on GitHub's servers. You can have multiple remotes so each requires a name. For your main one, this is commonly named *origin*.

~~~bash
$ git remote add origin <YOUR_URL_FROM_GITHUB>
~~~

Your local repository now knows where your remote one named 'origin' is (i.e. on GitHub). T

**Note:**
   If you have GitHub for Windows on your computer, a remote named 'origin' is automatically created. In that case, you'll just need to tell it what URL to associate with origin. Use this command instead of the 'add' one above: ``$ git remote set-url origin <YOUR_URL_FROM_GITHUB>``

### Pull down the changes on the remote repo
You created a .gitignore file on the remote repo. You need to *pull* this change into your local repo. Git has a branching system so that you can work on different parts of a project at different times but by default the first branch is named 'master'. When you pull (and push) from a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the name of the remote that it lives on.
- Enter the following command to pull the remote changes into the master branch on your local repo:
~~~bash
$ git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
~~~ 
- The ``--allow-unrelated-histories`` needs to be included as the local and remote repositories were created independently and have some commits.

Now we will *push* your local work (i.e. the readme.md) to the remote repo. 

### Push Work to your Remote

Next you want to push (send) everything you've done locally to GitHub. Ideally you want to stay in sync, meaning your local and remote versions match.

Similar to a pull, when you push from a project you tell Git the branch name you want to push and the name of the remote that it lives on.

In this case, we'll send our branch named 'master' to our remote on GitHub named 'origin'.

~~~bash
$ git push origin master
~~~

Now go to GitHub and refresh the page of your repository. Everything is the same locally and remotely. You should see the following in your local repo:

 You will use this repository to contain the rest of your lab work.
