## Refactoring.

The list of favorite movies are currently managed by a custom class, StubAPI. A better solution would be to integrate them into the movies context. The context's data structure can remain the same - a single property containing an array of movies. Now the array will be the full list of movies retrieved from TMDB, where each movie object will have an extra property, favorite, which is either true or false. True means it is in the favorites list. We will use the useReducer hook to manage the movies array - changing a movie's favorite property.

In `src/contexts/movieContext.js` replace the entire code with the following:

~~~
import React, { useEffect, createContext, useReducer } from "react";
import { getMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = createContext(null);

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "add-favorite":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id ? { ...m, favorite: true } : m
        ),
      };
    case "load":
      return { movies: action.payload.movies };
    case "add-review":
      // Completed in next section
      break;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { movies: [] });

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const index = state.movies.map((m) => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
    dispatch({ type: "add-favorite", payload: { movie: state.movies[index] } });
  };

  const addReview = (movie, review) => {
     // Completed in next section
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load", payload: { movies } });
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: state.movies,
        favorites: state.favorites,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites,
        addReview: addReview,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
~~~
Some points to note:

+ useReducer hook takes two arguments:

    + The initial value for the state object, i.e.
{ movies: [] }
    + a function that manages the mutation of the state object - reducer (arbitrary name).

+ useReducer returns a reference to the current state object and a reference to a dispatch function for sending/dispatching mutation requests to the reducer function.
+ Our reducer function supports three types of state mutation:

    + Load the movies returned by TMDB into the state.
    + Add a movie to the list of favorites by setting its favorite property to true.
    + Attach a review to a favorite movie (See nect section).

+ The dispatch function signature includes the name of a mutation type (what state change to perform) and the payload/data associated with the mutation.
+ Internally the dispatcher invokes the reducer function passing it the current state object and the mutation details.
+ The reducer function does NOT change the current state object, instead, it returns a new copy of it with the relevant changes applied. The copy becomes the new state object. This state-change strategy is mandated by the useReducer hook.

In `pages/favoriteMoviesPage.js` replace the entire content with the following:
~~~
import React, {useContext} from "react";
import MovieListPageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import AddReviewButton from '../components/buttons/addReview'
import {MoviesContext} from '../contexts/moviesContext'
 
const FavoriteMoviesPage = props => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
  const favorites = context.movies.filter( m => m.favorite )
  return (
    <MovieListPageTemplate
      movies={favorites}
      title={"Favorite Movies"}
      action={movie => <AddReviewButton movie={movie} />}
    />
  );
};

export default FavoriteMoviesPage;
~~~
The only change here is we switched from using the stub API to the movies context. We also compute the list of favorites by filtering the full movie list based on a movie's favorite property (being true).

In `pages/homePage.js` we must also compute the list of movies to display, as follows:
~~~

const MovieListPage = () => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);
  const movies = context.movies.filter((m) => {  // New
    return !("favorite" in m);
  });

  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="No. Movies"
      movies={movies}  /* Changed */
      action={(movie) => {
        return <AddToFavoritesButton movie={movie} />;
      }}
    />
  );
};
~~~

In the browser, check the add favorites feature works as before.

Update the project git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor add favorites feature"
$ git push origin main
~~~
