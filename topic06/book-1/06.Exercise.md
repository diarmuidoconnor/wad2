# Exercises.
## Exercise 1.

The Upcoming movies page you developed in the previous lab no longer works due to the refactoring we carried out. You should make the necessary adjustments to your code to get it working again.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Fix upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin main
~~~
## Exercise 2.

Suppose we want the movies on the Upcoming movies page to have a different action icon(s), as shown:

![][buttonw]

The icon is called PlaylistAdd: 

![][playlistadd]

Ultimately, it should allow the user to add the movie to their 'to watch' list. For now, you only need this icon to render on the page's movie cards - it does not need to trigger any action.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "New button for upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 3.

Currently, the Upcoming movies page retrieves the list of upcoming movies using the useEffect hook. Consequently, every time the page is mounted, an HTTP request is made to TMDB. A better solution would be to leverage the caching support provided by the react-query library. 

__You are required__ to change the implementation to meet this requirement. On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Change upcoming movies page to use caching."
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 4.

Returning to the 'Add to Watch List' icon (from Exercise 2), suppose clicking causes the movie to be added to a 'Must Watch' list, similar to the Favourites list. __You are required__ to implement this requirement.

[Hint: Add a new state variable (of type array) to the MoviesContext for storing the ids of the movies tagged as 'must watch'. Add a function for updating this state variable. Have a click event handle associated with the icon that calls the update function. 

To confirm the feature is working, use console.log to output the content of the new state variable array.]

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Tagging upcoming movies as must-watch."
$ git push origin main
~~~

-----------------------------
Ideally, the tagged movie should be reflected in the Upcoming movies page, as shown below:

![][mustwatch]

This feature would require significant refactoring, but you are not required to tackle this.
