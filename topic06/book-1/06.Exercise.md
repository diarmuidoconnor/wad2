## Exercise 1.

The Upcoming movies page you developed in the previous no longer works due to the refactoring we carried out earlier. Make the necessary adjustments to your code to get it working again.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Fix upcoming movies page"
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 2.

Suppose we want the movies on the Upcoming movies page to have a different button, as shown:

![][buttonw]

For now the button need not do anything; it just needs to be different to those on the other movie list pages. 

Make the necessary additions to your app code to achieve this. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "New button for upcoming movies page"
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 3.

Currently the upcoming page component retrieves the list of movies itself. Alternatively we could place this functionality in the MoviesContext. Replace the current content of `src/contexts/moviesContext.js` with the following:
~~~
import React, { useEffect, createContext, useReducer } from "react";
import { getMovies, getUpcomingMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = createContext(null);

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "add-favorite":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id ? { ...m, favorite: true } : m
        ),
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming],
      };
    case "load":
      return { movies: action.payload.movies, upcoming: [...state.upcoming] };
    case "load-upcoming":
      return { upcoming: action.payload.movies, movies: [...state.movies] };
    case "add-review":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id
            ? { ...m, review: action.payload.review }
            : m
        ),
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming],
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { movies: [], upcoming: [] });

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const index = state.movies.map((m) => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
    dispatch({ type: "add-favorite", payload: { movie: state.movies[index] } });
  };

  const addReview = (movie, review) => {
    dispatch({ type: "add-review", payload: { movie, review } });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load", payload: { movies } });
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    getUpcomingMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load-upcoming", payload: { movies } });
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: state.movies,
        upcoming: state.upcoming,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites,
        addReview: addReview,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
~~~
Above we have extended the state of the provider component (and consequently the context) to include the upcoming movies. The reducer function has an additional action - load-upcoming. For each action case in the reducer we must return the __full state data structure__, including those parts of the state an action does not change, e.g. the add-favorite does not change the list of upcoming movies.

__You are required__ to change your upcoming movies page component to now get its list of movies from the context. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Change upcoming movies page to use context"
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 4.

Returning to the 'Add to Watch List' button, suppose clicking it causes the movie to be tagged as a movie to watch in the future. This should result in the movie no longer appearing on the upcoming movies page. [Ideally we should add a new page that lists those movies tagged as one to watch but you can ignore this aspect.] Make the necessary changes to your app code to achieve this. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Tag movies to watch in the future"
$ git push origin main
~~~
