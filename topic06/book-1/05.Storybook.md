Iâ€™m ## Update Storybook.

The storybook stories we wrote in part 1 of this series no longer work due to refactoring and enhancements made to the components in subsequent labs. To fix this, download [this archive][stories], unzip it and copy each of the files into your `src/stories` folder - you are overwriting your current story files.


The critical differences in the updated story implementations are as follows:

1. Sometimes, a component expects/requires a particular component type to be above it in the component hierarchy. In Storybook, we need to *add a Decorator* to the story to satisfy these requirements. A decorator wraps a story's component inside another component. The most common wrappers are Contexts and Routers.  
1. Any component that uses the Link component needs to be wrapped inside a Router component. In the app code, the BrowserRouter component served this purpose. In Storybook, we can use MemoryRouter, which is more lightweight.
1. A decorator is also used for stories that require the MoviesContext provider.
1. Ditto for components that use the QueryClient provider.

For example, the stories for the MovieDetails component need the MemoryRouter and MoviesContextProvider as decorators:

~~~
export default {
  title: "Movie Details Page/MovieDetails",
  component: MovieDetails,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>{Story()}</MemoryRouter>,
    (Story) => <MoviesContextProvider>{Story()}</MoviesContextProvider>,
  ],
};

export const Basic = () => <MovieDetails movie={SampleMovie} />;

Basic.storyName = "Default";
~~~

Start the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
In the storybook, UI test all the stories.
