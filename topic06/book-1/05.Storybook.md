## Update Storybook.

The storybook stories we wrote in part 1 of this series no longer work due to refactoring and enhancements made to the components in subsequent labs. To fix this, download [this archive][stories], unzip it and copy each of the files into your `src/stories` folder - you are overwriting your current story files.

The critical differences in the updated story implementations are as follows:

1. Sometimes, a component expects/requires a particular component type to be above it in the component hierarchy. In Storybook, we need to *add a Decorator* to the story to satisfy these requirements. A decorator wraps a story's component inside another component. The most common wrappers are Contexts and Routers.  
1. Any component that uses the Link component needs to be wrapped inside a Router component. In the app code, the BrowserRouter component served this purpose. In Storybook, we can use MemoryRouter, which is more lightweight.
1. A decorator is also used for stories that require the MoviesContext provider.
1. Ditto for components that use the QueryClient provider.

Start the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~

An error is thrown n the StoryBook UI:

![][storieserror]

Download and unzip [this archive][stories]. Copy the `stories` folder to the `src` folder of your project - overwriting the current `src/stories` folder. Refresh the Storybook UI in the browser. All the stories should now render correctly.

Review the updated story files. For example, the stories for the MovieDetails component (in `src/stories/movieDetails.stories.js`) needed the MemoryRouter and MoviesContextProvider as decorators:

~~~
export default {
  title: "Movie Details Page/MovieDetails",
  component: MovieDetails,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>{Story()}</MemoryRouter>,
    (Story) => <MoviesContextProvider>{Story()}</MoviesContextProvider>,
  ],
};

export const Basic = () => <MovieDetails movie={SampleMovie} />;
Basic.storyName = "Default";
