# Get Git

![git](./img/git1.png)

You will probably have git from the previous labs. If not, follow the instructions for your operating system.

### Windows OS
If you're on Windows, download the  **GitHub Desktop**, from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) which includes Git, and use the Git Shell for your terminal.


### Mac

You can install Git automatically. To do this, open the Terminal application from spotlight and type `git`. This will prompt Git to install the rest of the command line tools for Git. This should only take a few minutes. It will ask if you would like to download Xcode, which you can ignore.

### Linux

You can use the package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:

~~~bash
$ sudo yum install git-all 
~~~

For Debian use:

~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
~~~

## Tell Git who you are

You will need to configure git with your identity so that it can record your git activity such as repo creation and changes. To set a global identity for all repos on the machine, enter the following:

~~~bash
$ git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
~~~

## Clone a Repository

### Clone the samples repository

Select a location on your machine where you would like to keep the code examples taken from the weekly talks. Open a terminal window in that location and clone the samples repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/fxwalsh/ewd-examples-2019.git
```

This should create a new folder called *ewd-examples-2019*. Open the folder and you should see the node samples from the lecture slides. We will use this repository for our example code as the module progresses. You will need to *pull* the repository from time to time to get the latest code examples from the lectures.

## Create a repository

You can think of a repository as a project folder with all the related files inside of it.

You initialise a folder as a  Git repository and Git will start tracking the changes to that folder. Any files added, removed or changed are tracked and time stamped by Git. That's version control.

You're going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git repository.
Make a new folder by opening a terminal window at a suitable  location on your machine. Enter the following commands to make a new directory called *ewd-node-labs-2019* and then change directory into it :

~~~bash
$ mkdir ewd-node-labs-2019
$ cd ewd-node-labs-2019
~~~

Now initialise the folder as a Git repo:

~~~bash
$ git init
~~~

To check that it's a Git repository, type ``git status`` and if returns something like 'On branch master ....', you've got a new local repo!

## Add to the repository

Open a text editor. Now write a couple of lines of text:

~~~text
# Node Development Practical Labs
~~~

and save the file as ``readme.md`` in the *ewd-node-labs-2019* folder.

## Status, Add and Commit Changes
Next check the status of your repository to find out if there have been changes. In the terminal, you should still be within the 'ewd-node-labs-2019' directory. Enter ``git status`` for a report on any changes listed:

~~~bash
$ git status
~~~

![Git Status](./img/git-status.png)

You can see that the *readme.md* file is untracked at the moment. Add it to the files you'd like to track with Git.

~~~bash
$ git add readme.md
~~~

Finally, commit those changes to the repository's history with a short description of the updates.

~~~bash
$ git commit -m "Created the readme file"
~~~

### Make More Changes

Now add another line to *readme.md* and save.

In terminal, you can view the difference between the file now and how it was at your last commit using ``git diff``.

Now, what you just learned above, commit this latest change.
