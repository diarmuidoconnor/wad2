## GitHub setup.

Go to your Github account and create a new repository called wad2-moviesApp. 

![][github]

In VS Code, assuming the app is already imported, open an integrated terminal and type the commands (Insert your Github username in the URL):
~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/[your github username]/wad2-moviesApp.git
$ git push -u origin master
~~~
Check that the new repository on GitHub now has your complete set of project files.
