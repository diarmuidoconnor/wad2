## Movie Reviews.

In the Movie Details page we want to optionally list an extract from each related critic review. A simple Show/Hide button allows the user controls the inclusion of the reviews: 

![][extracts]

Each extract has a 'Full Review' link which displays the full review text on a separate page:

![][review]

### Refactoring.

Notice that both of the above pages have the same outline layout. We should refactor the current code to avail of this similarity. This time reusability will be achieved using component composition based on the *container* pattern.

Create the file `src/components/templateMoviePage/index.js` and add the following code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import MovieHeader from '../headerMovie'
import "./moviePage.css";

const TemplateMoviePage = ({ movie, children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <MovieHeader movie={movie} />
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-3">
          <img
            src={
              movie.poster_path
                ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${movie.poster_path}`
                : "./film-poster-placeholder.png"
            }
            className="movie"
            alt={movie.title}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="col-9">{children}</div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default TemplateMoviePage;
~~~
The use of the *children* prop in the above code provides the opportunity for component composition. At runtime 'children' will be bound to the JSX element/component provided by the consumer component, i.e. the component performing the composition.

Create the file `src/components/templateMoviePage/moviePage.css` and copy in this code:
~~~
img.movie {
    float: left;
    width: 100%;
    height: 25rem;
  }
~~~
[You can now delete the file `src/pages/moviePage.css` as it is redundant.]

To use the above template/container, in `src/pages/movieDetailsPage.js` replace the entire content with the following:
~~~
import React, {useState, useEffect } from "react";
import MovieDetails from "../components/movieDetails";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMoviePage";
import {getMovie} from '../api/tmdb-api'

const MoviePage = props => {
  const { id } = props.match.params;
  const [movie, setMovie] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    getMovie(id).then(movie => {
      setMovie(movie);
    });
  }, [id]);
  return (
    <>
      {movie ? (
          <PageTemplate movie={movie}>
            <MovieDetails movie={movie} />
          </PageTemplate>
      ) : (
        <p>Waiting for movie details</p>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default MoviePage;
~~~
On mounting, this component's first rendering will occur before the useEffect hook has received the API data. We use Javascript's ternary operator (?:) to display a 'Waiting for data' message' in this case - the movie state variable is initialized to null, which evaluates to boolean false. When the data is available, the movie state variable is initialized and the ternary expression now renders the movie details. This is a frequently used technique.

In the above code component composition occurs in the lines:
~~~
<PageTemplate movie={movie}>
    <MovieDetails movie={movie} />
</PageTemplate>
~~~
The MovieDetails component is bound to the children prop of PageTemplate at runtime.

In the browser check the movie details page renders as before.

### Showing movie reviews.

We will develop the code for this feature from the ground up, starting with the API call. In `src/api/tmdb-api.js` add a new function at the bottom:
~~~
export const getMovieReviews = id => {
  return fetch(
    `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${id}/reviews?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}`
  )
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => json.results);
};
~~~

Create the file `src/components/movieReviews/index.js` and add code to display review extracts in a table layout, as follows:
~~~
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { getMovieReviews } from "../../api/tmdb-api";
import { excerpt } from "../../util";

export default ({ movie }) => {
  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getMovieReviews(movie.id).then(reviews => {
      setReviews(reviews);
    });
  }, []);
  return (
    <table className="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Author</th>
          <th scope="col">Excerpt</th>
          <th scope="col">More</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {reviews.map(r => {
            return (
              <tr key={r.id}>
                <td>{r.author}</td>
                <td>{excerpt(r.content)}</td>
                <td>
                  {" "}
                  <Link
                    to={{
                      pathname: `/reviews/${r.id}`,
                      state: {
                        review: r,
                        movie: movie
                      }
                    }}
                  >
                    Full Review
                  </Link>
                </td>
              </tr>
            );
          })}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};
~~~
The component maps over the array of reviews retrieved from the API. Two points to note about the code above:

+ Each review in the table has a hyperlink to navigate to a 'full review' page. 
+ The hyperlinks use the extended option of the Link component, allowing it to pass two objects (movie and review) to full review page component - yet to be developed. Currently no route matches the link's path - /reviews/:id.
+ We are using a utility function to truncate a reviews text. Create the file `src/util.js` and add this utility function:
~~~
import _ from "lodash";

export function excerpt(string) {
  const truncate = _.truncate;
  return truncate(string, {
    length: 200, // maximum 200 characters
    separator: /,?\.* +/ // separate by spaces, including preceding commas and periods
  });
}
~~~
To connect the above component to the Movie Details page we will use a *nested route*. The URLs will be:

+ /movies/:id - Display basic Movies Details page.
+ /movies/:id/reviews (nested route) - Include review excerpts at the bottom of the Movies Details page.


In `pages/movieDetailsPage.js` make these changes:

+ add some imports at the top:
~~~
import { Link, Route, withRouter } from "react-router-dom"
import MovieReviews from "../components/movieReviews"
~~~

+ replace the return statement with the following:
~~~
  return (
    <>
    {movie ? (
      <>
        <PageTemplate movie={movie}>
          <MovieDetails movie={movie} />
        </PageTemplate>
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-12 ">
            {!props.history.location.pathname.endsWith("/reviews") ? (
              <Link
                className="btn btn-primary btn-block active"
                to={`/movies/${id}/reviews`}
              >
                Show Reviews (Extracts)
              </Link>
            ) : (
              <Link
                className="btn btn-primary btn-block active"
                to={`/movies/${id}`}
              >
                Hide Reviews 
              </Link>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
        <Route
          path={`/movies/:id/reviews`}
          render={props => <MovieReviews movie={movie} {...props} />}
        />
      </>
    ) : (
      <p>Waiting for movie details</p>
    )}
  </>
  );
~~~
+ replace the export statement with:
~~~
export default withRouter(MoviePage);
~~~
Points to note:
1. The React-Router withRouter function injects the history prop into our component. This prop gives us access to the browser's current URL address.
1. The nested Route component causes the inclusion of the reviews table when the browser's URL ends with '/reviews'.
1. The Show/Hide button is implemented with the Link component to allow us change the browser's URL when clicked.
1. The history prop is used in a ternary operator to decide between the Show/Hide button options. 

is used to the Show/Hide button. The operator uses the history prop to base its decision.

In the browser:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click any movie. 
1. Click the 'Show Reviews' button in the resulting details page. [Some movies have no reviews, in which case just choose another movie.]
1. The review extracts should appear at the bottom of the page.
