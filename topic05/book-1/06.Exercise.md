## Exercise.

TMDB has a number of __endpoints__ for requesting data. We have already used three, Discover, Movies, Genres, Reviews. The Movies endpoint has a number query options, for example, 'upcoming'. It returns a list of upcoming movies in theatres - see more [here][endpoint]). 

__You are required__ to add a new page to the app which displays a list of upcoming movies. As shown in the screenshot, the new page's URL should be '/movies/upcoming', the site header should include a navigation link to this page, and the pages layout should closely mirror the home page's. 

![][upcoming]

According to the TMDB documentation, the upcomong movies endpoint  URL must be:

>>https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=<<api_key>>&language=en-US&page=1

On completing this exercise, update the git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added Upcoming movies page"
$ git push origin master
~~~

[endpoint]: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming
[upcoming]: ./img/upcoming.png
