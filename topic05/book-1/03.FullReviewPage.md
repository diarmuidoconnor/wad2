## Full Review Page.

We can now develop a page that displays the full text of a movie review. Create the file `src/components/movieReview/index.js` and add this code:

```
import React from "react";

const MovieReview =  ({ review }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Review By: {review.author} </p>
      <p>{review.content} </p>
    </>
  );
};
export default MovieReview
```

Create the file `src/pages/movieReviewPage.js` and add this code:

```
import React from "react";
import { withRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMoviePage";
import MovieReview from "../components/movieReview";

const MovieReviewPage = (props) => {
  const {movie, review} = props.location.state
  return (
    <PageTemplate movie={movie}>
      <MovieReview review={review} />
    </PageTemplate>
  );
};

export default withRouter(MovieReviewPage);
```

This full review page is rendered when the user clicks a review excerpt's 'Full Review' link. As explained in the previous section, that link included two object references - movie and review. Our new page can access these objects through the _location_ prop (props.location.state). Also, we use component composition above, this time between the template and the MovieReview components.

The final step is to add a route for the new page to `src/index.js`, as follows:

- add an import at the top:

```
import MovieReviewPage from "./pages/movieReviewPage";
```

- Add a route:

```
<Switch>
    <Route path="/reviews/:id" component={MovieReviewPage} />
    . . . other routes . . .
</Switch>
```

In the browser:

1. Go to the home page and click on a movie.
1. On the movie details page, click the Reviews button. 
1. Click the 'Full Review' link of one of the review excerpts.

Update the git repository as follows:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Full review page."
$ git push origin master
```
