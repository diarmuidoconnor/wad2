## Custom hooks.

By creating custom hooks we extract component logic into reusable functions. As an example we will define a custom hook that encapsulating the state management logic related to the movie data type. 

Create the file `src/hooks/useMovie.js` and add this code:
~~~
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import {getMovie} from '../api/tmdb-api'

const useMovie = id => {
  const [movie, setMovie] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    getMovie(id).then(movie => {
      setMovie(movie);
    });
  }, [id]);
  return [movie, setMovie];
};

export default useMovie
~~~
We are not declaring a component here, just a function.

To use our custom hook, in `pages/movieDetailsPage.js` replace the beginning of the code with the following:
~~~
import React from "react";
import { Link, Route, withRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import MovieDetails from "../components/movieDetails";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMoviePage";
import MovieReviews from "../components/movieReviews";
import useMovie from "../hooks/useMovie";

const MoviePage = props => {
  const { id } = props.match.params;
  const [movie] = useMovie(id)  // NEW
  return (
      . . . . as before . . . . 
  )
};

export default withRouter(MoviePage);
~~~
This page component no longer has the useState and useEffect hooks as they have moved to our custom hook. 

Commit this work:
