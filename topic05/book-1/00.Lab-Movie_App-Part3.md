# Developing a Movies Fan App - Part 3.

in this lab we tackle the third development iteration of the Movies Fan app. 

Based on the feature list mentioned in Part 1 of this series, in this iteration we will  implemented the following:

+ In the Movie details page the user can optionally show an excerpt from published critic reviews.
+ Clicking the 'More' link on a review excerpt will display the full review text on a separate page.
+ A more professional-styled site header is added.

Two new React coding techniques will be used during the implementation:

+ A Component composition pattern.
+ Custom hooks.

Also, two routing featured will be leveraged:

+ Nested routes.
+ Extended Link.
