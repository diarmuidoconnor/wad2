## The Bootstrap CSS library.

The current styling problem in our app is due to the omission of the Bootstrap CSS file. Stop the server and install it at the integrated terminal, as follows:
~~~
$ npm install --save  bootstrap@4.4.1
$ npm start
~~~
The traditional approach (which we won't use) to referencing CSS is by adding a link tag to `index.html`:
~~~
<link href="... path to CSS file ..." rel="stylesheet">
~~~
A newer and more developer-friendly approach is to reference it directly from the JS code. Replace the entire content of `src/index.js` with the following:
~~~
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'
import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
~~~

The app should now be rendering as planned. 

Commit this work:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Styled with Bootstrap"
~~~
