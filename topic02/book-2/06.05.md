## Building a production app.

While the app is now complete, the development server environment is unsuitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not happen dynamically, and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
$ npm run build
~~~
This command creates a `build` folder to house the production-quality, static form of the app:

![][build]

The name of the minified file containing your React code is a computed hash value of its content, e.g. `main.3292776c.chunk.js`. This naming strategy aids the browser's caching operations.

We can use VS Code's Live Server extension to demo the production version of the app. Open a new window in VS Code:

![][window]

Drag-and-drop the project's `build` folder to the new VS Code window. Start the  Live server by clicking the 'Go Live' link in the status bar at the bottom. The browser should be rendering your app.

Notice, the project's `.gitignore` file (generated by CRA) includes the `/build` folder - we never commit generated files/folders to a repository.
