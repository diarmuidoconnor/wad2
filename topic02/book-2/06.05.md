## Building a production app.

The app is now complete but clearly the development server environment is not suitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not be happening dynamically and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
$ npm run build
~~~
This creates a `build` folder to house the production-quality, static form of the app:

![][build]

The name of the minified file containing your React code is a computed hash value of its content. This is an aid to browser caching operations.

To use the production version of the app we can use VS Code's Live Server extension. Open a new window in VS Code:

![][window]

Import the project's `build` folder to the new window. Click 'Go Live'. The browser should be rendering your app.

Notice in the project's `.gitignore` file (generated by CRA) the `/build` folder is included - we  never commit generated files/folders to a repository. Performing a git commit anytime in the future will not cause the build files to be stored in the repository.
