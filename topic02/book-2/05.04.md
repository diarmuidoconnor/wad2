## Live reloading.

In `src/index.js` notice the statement:
~~~
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
~~~
This attaches the App component (and its subordinates - Course and Modules) to the browser's DOM at the element with id 'root'. This element was declared by create-react-app in the body of `public/index.html`:
~~~
<div id="root"></div>
~~~
The tool's development server treats `public/index.html` as a template. On starting the server it performs the following tasks:

1. Merges all the JS code, starting at `src/index.js`, into one JS asset. This includes your custom JS code, React and other third party libraries.
1. Inserts a script tag into the body of `index.html` to reference the merged asset.

During development mode their is no evidence of the merged JS on your filesystem. It only appears when in production mode.

Live reloading is a great aid when debugging. As a simple example, suppose we deliberately add an error to `src/App.js` by changing the line:
~~~
const name = "HDip Computer Systems";
~~~
to:
~~~
const course_name = "HDip Computer Systems";
~~~
On saving this change the tool re-transpiles the code and reports any errors to the terminal window:

![][error]
 
And also in the browser

![][error2]

Undo the change to fix the error.

[error2]: ./img/error2.png
