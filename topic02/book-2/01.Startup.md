## Startup.

The two apps being developed over the coming weeks are:

+ Contact list, and
+ Hacker News. 

This lab is focused on step one of the *Thinking in React* process - the development process recommended by the React design team (discussed in a later lectures). This step is titled `Build a static version` of the app. In subsequent labs we will add user interaction and routing.

Download [this zip][start] as the starting point and unzip it. It contains two skeleton apps, one for each of the above mentioned use case. The apps were generated with the `create-react-app` tool. We will also use Git to keep a log of the work done over the coming weeks.
