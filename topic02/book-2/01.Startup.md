## Startup.

For convenience, we will use the 'course modules' context again in this lab. 

Create a new empty folder (away from `basicReactLab`). Open an ordinary operating system terminal/shell window and type the commands:
~~~
$ npx create-react-app course-app
$ cd course-app
~~~
The first command **scaffolds** a React project, located in a new folder called `course-app` with content similar to that illustrated below:

![][scaffold]

Now import the `course-app` folder into VS Code. CRA creates a runnable app from the outset. To prove it, in VS Code, open an integrated terminal and type the command:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
This command performs the following task sequence:

- Transpiles any JSX and ES6 code in the `src` folder, starting with `src/index.js` and then follows the import statements to find other dependencies. Note, you will not see physical evidence of the transpiled files on the filesystem. The files will only occur at the production stage (covered later).
- Starts a **development-mode web server** on port 3000.
- Opens a tab in your default web browser and issue an HTTP request to http://localhost:3000/
- The server responds with `public/index.html`, followed by relevant assets (transpiled JS, CSS etc.).

The server performs **live reloading** - watches all project source files for updates, and on detecting a change, it re-transpiles the relevant files and hot-reloads them in the browser.

The browser should now be displaying the default React app:

![][default]

We will mould this skeleton app into our simple custom app. The desired user interface we want to achieve is similar to the following (Substitute the course name and module names accordingly):

![][obj]

The app's component hierarchy design will be as follows:
~~~
       App (default)
        |
        |
        V
      Course
        |
        |  
        V
      Module
~~~
The App component renders a child called Course. Course renders many instances of a Module component.
