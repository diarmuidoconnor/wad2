## Exercise 4 (Iteration).
 
In the previous exercise, the component was hard-coded to expect a modules array prop of exactly two elements. It should be flexible enough to handle any array size. 

__You are required__ to implement your solution to this requirement in `src/components/exercises/04_iteration.js`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.js` as a guide.

In `src/stories/exercises/04-component.stories.js`.there is an implementation of a story for this exercise.

The Storybook UI renders your solution by clicking 'Exercises -> 04 - iteration'. It should resemble the following:

See the Solutions section at the end for an outline solution.

On completing the exercise, update the local repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 4 completed."
~~~
That completes the lab.
