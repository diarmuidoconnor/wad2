## Startup.

Download and unzip [this archive][code] and import it into VS Code - drag and drop.

![][vscode] 

Open an integrated terminal in the editor:

![][terminal] 

and type the command:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~
[You will receive warning messages in the response, but you can ignore them.]

This command installs the JS modules needed (e.g. React and its dependencies) in a local folder, called `node_modules`.

![][install] 

This downloaded archive contains the following top-level folder structure:
~~~
     basicReactLab
       |
       |---.storybook
       |---src
            |---components
                  |
                  |---exercises
                  |---samples
            |
            |---stories
                  |
                  |---exercises
                  |---samples          
~~~
Your primary focus will be on the two sub-folders of `src/components`. There are completed sample components in `src/components/samples`, as covered in the lectures. The `src/components/exercises` folder has skeleton implementations of the components you will develop during this lab. In the VS Code integrated terminal, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
This command is shorthand for:

>npx start-storybook -p 6006

This command runs the binary executable `./node_modules/.bin/start-storybook`. The 'start-storybook' executable transpiles all ES6 and JSX code, starts the storybook web server on port 6006, opens a web browser tab and navigate to http://localhost:6006 :

### The sample components.

Each file in the `src/components/samples` folder contains a component implementation. The file names are prefixed with a sequence number (01_, 02_ etc.) to help relate them to the text name in the Storybook UI side panel. For example, in the Storybook UI, you can access the component declared in `src/components/samples/03_props.js` by navigating to 'Samples -> 03 - component with props':

![][numbers] 

It is conventional for a component file name to match the component name exported by the file. This practice is not applied here only for convenience sake.

The Storybook server provides live reloading - you can see the effect of code changes immediately. For example, in the browser, click the `01 - static component` sample. Open the file `src/components/samples/01_staticComponent.js` and change the list of languages to the following:
~~~
<ul>
   <li>Erlang</li>
   <li>Clojure</li>
</ul>  
~~~
Save the change and return to the browser - the browser automatically updates.

### The exercises components.

Click on any of the exercise components in the Storybook UI side panel; they are incomplete.

![][exercises] 

Leave the Storybook server running while completing this lab's exercises. If you do need to stop it, hit 'cntl/c'. To restart it, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
