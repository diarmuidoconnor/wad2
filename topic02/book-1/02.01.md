## Exercise 1 (Static Component).

__You are required__ to use the React framework to implement a simple (static) component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below:

![][exercise1]

As a guide, the raw HTML table syntax for the above might look as follows:

      <table className="table table-bordered">
           <thead>
              <tr>
              <th>Name</th>
              <th>No lectures</th>
              <th>No practicals</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody >
            <tr>
              <td>DevOps</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>2</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody >
    </table>

For now assume exactly two modules are included in the table body. The story for this exercise is already implemented. In `stories/exercises.js` see:

    .add("01 - static component", () => {
      return <CourseModulesStatic />;
    })

The steps to completing this exercise are:

+ __Step 1__: In the browser, in the side panel of the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. Examine the related component code in `components/samples/01_staticComponent.js`. Use this code as a guide for this exercise.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 01 - static component'. Open the related code:  `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. Implement the render method to produce the desired output. 

As you work through this exercise, check how the component is rendering in the browser. Remember live-reloading is happens every time you perform a file save.

On completion, stop the Storybook server and update the local Git repo:

        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Exercise 1 completed"

Restart the server:

      $ npx start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook
