## Exercise 1 (Static Component).

__You are required__ to implement a (static) React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below:

![][exercise1]

[Use your own course title and module names]
As a guide, the raw HTML table syntax for the list of modules above might look as follows:
~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody >
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody >
</table>
~~~
For now assume exactly two modules are included in the table body. The story for this exercise is already implemented - see `stories/exercises.stories.js`:
~~~
  .add("01 - static component", () => {
    return <CourseModulesStatic />;
  })
~~~
The steps to completing this exercise are:

+ __Step 1__: In the side panel of the Storybook UI (in the browser), click the link: 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. Examine the related component code in `components/samples/01_staticComponent.js`. Use it as a guide for this exercise.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 01 - static component'. Open the related component file:  `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. Change the function's return statement to produce the desired output. 

As you work through a solution, save the changes and check how the updated component is rendering in the browser - live-reloading is happens every time you perform a file save. 

You may wish to consult the 'Exercise 1 solution' in the solutions tab.

On completion, stop the Storybook server and update the local Git repo:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 1 completed"
~~~
Restart the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
