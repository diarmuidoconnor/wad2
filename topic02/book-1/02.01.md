## Exercise 1 (Static Component).

__You are required__ to implement a static React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below (You may wish to substitute your course title and module names in the solution):

![][exercise1]

You are required to implement the solution in the file `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. As a guide, the raw HTML table syntax for the list of modules above might look as follows:
~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody >
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody >
</table>
~~~
[The CSS classes used above are from the Bootstrap library. It is not necessary to be familiar with it for this lab. We will not be using it in subsequent labs.]

For now, assume the table body has exactly two modules. The is already an implementation for the story - see `src/stories/exercises/01-component.stories.js`.

The steps to completing this challenge are:

+ __Step 1__: In the side panel of the Storybook UI (in the browser), click the link: 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. Examine the related component code in `src/components/samples/01_staticComponent.js`. Use it as a guide for your solution.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 01 - static component' and open the related component file: `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. Change the function's return body to produce the desired output - do not change the function name. 

As you work through a solution, save the changes and check how the updated component is rendering in the browser - live-reloading happens every time you save the file. 

You may wish to consult the 'Solutions' in the last section of this lab.

On completion, in the VS Code integrated terminal panel, stop the Storybook server and update the local Git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 1 completed."
~~~
Restart the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
