## Exercise 2 (Embedded variables).

In exercise 1, the data was hard-coded in the JSX - course name, module details. A slight improvement would be to place the data in local variables (e.g. a two-element array for the modules) and reference them from the JSX code. __You are required__ to implement this improvement; however, we will use a separate component file, `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js`, for convenience. There is an implementation of the story for this exercise provided - see `src/stories/exercises/02-component.stories.js`.

The steps to complete this exercise are as follows:
 
+ __Step 1__: In the browser, click the link: 'Samples -> 02 - JSX embedded variables'. Examine the related component code in `src/components/samples/02_embeddedVariables.js`. Use this code as a guide for your solution.
+ __Step 2__: Copy the code from `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js` over to `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js` - we are using the solution from exercise 1 as the starting point.
+ __Step 3__: Modify the code in `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js` to use embedded variables for its data. Assume there are still only two modules in the table.
+ __Step 4__: In the browser, click the link: 'Exercises -> 02 - JSX embedded variables' to see the result of your implementation. 

Hint: The JSX excerpt below is a guide to the solution required:
~~~ 
  . . . . . . 
<tr>
  <td>{modules[1].name}</td>
  <td>modules[1].noLectures}</td>
  <td>{modules[1].noPracticals}</td>
</tr>
  . . . . . . . 
~~~

If necessary, see 'Solution' in the last section of the lab.

On completing the exercise, in the VS Code integrated terminal panel, stop the server and type these commands:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 2 completed."
~~~
Restart the server.
