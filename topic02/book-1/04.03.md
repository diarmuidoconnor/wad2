## Exercise 3 (Props).

Before addressing this exercise, first open `stories/exercises.stories.js` and locate the two data variables:
~~~
const name = "HDip Computer Science" // Course name
const modules = [
  {
    name: "DevOps",
    noLectures: 1,
    noPracticals: 2
  },
  . . . . other modules
];
~~~
Change these to better reflect your course details.

The next design improvement to our component is to make it __reusable__ by passing any model data in as __props__, specifically:

+ An array of (exactly two) modules and
+ The course name. 

The story for this exercise is already implemented in `stories/exercises.stories.js` - see these lines:
~~~
   .add("03 - component with props", () => {
       const twoModules = [modules[0], modules[1]];
       return <CourseModulesWithProps modules={twoModules} course={name} />;
   })
~~~
Implement your solution in `components/exercises/03_props.js`. Use the solution to exercise 2 as the starting point and reference `components/samples/03_props.js` as a guide to the changes required. Note, your component must use the same prop names as the story above, i.e. course and modules

In the browser, click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' to see your solution render.
On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed"
~~~
Restart the server.
