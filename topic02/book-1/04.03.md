## Exercise 3 (Props).

The following design improvement to our component is to make it __reusable__; we will pass the model data in as __props__. The props will be:

+ An array of (still only two) modules and
+ The course name. 

The file `src/stories/exercises/03-component.stories.js`.contains an implementation of the story for this exercise.

Implement your solution in `src/components/exercises/03_props.js`. Use the solution to exercise 2 as the starting point and reference `components/samples/03_props.js` to guide the changes required. Note, your component must use the same prop names as the story, i.e. course and modules.

In the browser, click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' to see your solution render.

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed."
~~~
Restart the server.
