# Register/Authenicate Users

You will update the **POST** HTTP method on */api/users* to both authenticate and register users. The *action* parameter in the query string can be used to distinguish between login and signup/register. We will also need to specify a secret environment variable that will be used to create the Javascript Web Token.

+ Add the following entry for the secret variable into the *.env* file

~~~bash
secret=ilikecake
~~~

+ Add the following import statement to */api/users/index.js*.

~~~javascript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
~~~

+ In the same script, replace the POST route for '/' with the following.

~~~javascript
//.... code as before

// Register/login a user
router.post('/', (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.body.username || !req.body.password) {
      res.json({
        success: false,
        msg: 'Please pass username and password.',
      });
    };
    if (req.query.action === 'register') {
      User.create({
        username: req.body.username,
        password: req.body.password,
      }).then(user => res.status(201).json({
        code: 201,
        msg: 'Successful created new user.',
      })).catch(next);
    } else {
      User.findByUserName(req.body.username).then(user =>{
      if (!user) return res.status(401).send({code: 401, msg: 'Authentication failed. User not found.'});
      user.comparePassword(req.body.password, (err, isMatch) => {
        if (isMatch && !err) {
          // if user is found and password is right create a token
          const token = jwt.sign(user.username, process.env.secret);
          // return the information including token as JSON
          res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            token: 'BEARER ' + token,
          });
        } else {
          res.status(401).send({
            code: 401,
            msg: 'Authentication failed. Wrong password.'
          });
        }
      });
    }).catch(next);
  }});


// ... Code as before
~~~

The above function checks for both username and password in the request. If the action parameter's value is "register", it attempts to create a new user in the database (using the mongoose User model). Otherwise, it authenticates the user, creates the JWT token using the secret and signed with the users username.
The token is then returned to the client for use in future requests.

## Testing using Postman

Test that you can create and authenticate a user by trying the following tests in Postman:

+ **Get Users**:Test that a HTTP GET for */api/users/* returns a collection of User documents with encrypted passwords.

![Get Users](./img/user1.png)

+ **Register a User**:Test that a HTTP POST for */api/users/* with ``action=regster`` as a parameter Adds a new User document with an encrypted password. Remember to include a User JSON document in the HTTP request body.

![Register a New User](./img/user2.png)

+ **Authenticate a User**:Test that a HTTP POST for */api/users/* authenticates a User. Again, remember to include a User JSON document in the HTTP request body.

![Authenticate a New User](./img/user3.png)

In this case, the API will return the JWT token in the response body.

+ **Unknown User/Password**: Try to authenticate with an unknown user. You should see the following response:

![Unknown User](./img/user4.png)
