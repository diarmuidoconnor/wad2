# API Testing Lab

This lab shows you how to test a Node API using Mocha, Should, Sinon, and SuperTest.

## Prerequisites

You need a working version of the Hacker News and Contacts API for this lab. The solution to the last lab you completed will suffice. Otherwise, you can get the solution from the  [GitHub examples repo](https://github.com/fxwalsh/ewd-examples-2019.git).
