In the last step, you added the following to */api/users/index.js* to add favourites

```javascript
//Add a favourite. No Error Handling Yet. Can add duplicates too!
router.post('/:userName/favourites', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const newFavourite = req.body.id;
  const userName = req.params.userName;
  const movie = await movieModel.findByMovieDBId(newFavourite);
  const user = await User.findByUserName(userName);
  await user.favourites.push(movie._id);
  await user.save(); 
  res.status(201).json(user); 
}));
```

The current solution allows duplicate entries in the favourites array(same movie more than once).  
- Improve the code so that a movie can only appear once in the favourites array. 

## Pasword Format
At the moment, there is no validation on the password format. 

- Use the following Regular Expression to ensure all passwords are at least 5 characters long and contain at least one number and one letter.

~~~
^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\d)[A-Za-z\d]{5,}$
~~~
Test it works by trying to register a new user with the password "BadPassword".  
NOTE: as you know this is not a good password format - it's just for testing purposes!
