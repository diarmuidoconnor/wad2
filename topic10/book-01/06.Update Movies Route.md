# Update Movies Route

At the moment we are proxying the Movies data from the TMDB api. It means our API is dependent on the TMDB API being available and accessable. This will make it more complex to implement some of the advanced functionality and we are completely dependent on the TMDB API.

We would like o make our API more independent and cohesive, so we will load the Movies collection in the MongoDB with some data to support this. 

## Add Movie Schema and Data
- Download the *Movies Data* archive from this topic on the course website, and extract the contents. 
- Copy *movies.js* to the */seedData* folder.
- Copy *movieModel.js* to the  */api/movies* folder.  
  

Have a look at the content of the files. The *movies.js* file exports an array of 20 movies. The *movieModel.js* contains a mongoose movies schema. We will use these in the next step to load movie data into the DB.

## Load Movies

- Open */seedData/index.js* and import the movieModel and  ``movies`` array exported from *movies.js*.

```javascript
import movieModel from '../api/movies/movieModel';
import movies from './movies.js';
```

- In the same file, add the following function,  ``loadMovies()``,  :

```javascript
// deletes all movies documents in collection and inserts test data
export async function loadMovies() {
  console.log('load seed data');
  console.log(movies.length);
  try {
    await movieModel.deleteMany();
    await movieModel.collection.insertMany(movies);
    console.info(`${movies.length} Movies were successfully stored.`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`failed to Load movie Data: ${err}`);
  }
}
```

- In the same file, locate the statement where the user data is loaded and add a call to the `loadMovies()` function:

```javascript

if (process.env.SEED_DB) {
  loadUsers();
  loadGenres();//you may not need this line if you skipped the exercises
  loadMovies();//ADD THIS LINE
}
```

## Update Movies Router

- Open ``/api/movies/index.js`` and replace the code for getting all movie data (GET '/')  with the following:

```javascript
router.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  movieModel.find().then(movies => res.status(200).send(movies)).catch(next);
});
```

- In the same file, replace the code for getting one movie (GET '/:id') with the following:

```javascript
router.get('/:id', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  movieModel.findByMovieDBId(id).then(movie => res.status(200).send(movie)).catch(next);
});
```

## Test It!

- Using Postman or another HTTP client, test that the '/api/movies' and '/api/movies/:id' routes work as before. Make a request for '/api/movies'
- Scroll down through the list and get an id(not the _id) of a Movie
![](./img/movies.png)
- Use the id from the last step to test the '/api/movies/:id' route:
