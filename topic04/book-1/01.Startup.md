## Startup.

The objective is to display detailed information about a contact when the user clicks their image on the main view - see example below:

![][detail1]

The additional information shown on this new page is taken from the JSON structure returned by the RandomUser API. Included in the structure are longitude and latitude reading, however, they are randomly generated and do not correlate to the contact address property. For this reason the map on the right is fixed at WIT, Waterford for demo purposes.  

The URL for the new view will be __parameterized__, for example:

>'http://localhost:3000/contacts/(810)-622-3633(535)-237-9962', where *(810)-622-3633(535)-237-9962* is a concatenation of the phone number and cell number for the contact (somewhat arbitrary). 

The general form of the URL is:

>http://localhost:3000/contacts/:id


### Setup.

In React apps routing is provided by a separate package - see react-router-dom entry in dependencies section of `package.json`. 

Some routing code changes we will make to existing components will break our Storybook code. To preempt this some enhancements are required in  `stories/index.js`. Add an import at the top:
~~~
import { MemoryRouter, Route } from "react-router";
~~~

Replace the Contact and Contact List stories with the following:
~~~
storiesOf("Contact List App/Contact", module)
.addDecorator(story => (
  <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>{story()}</MemoryRouter>
))
.add("default", () => ( 
   <Contact contact={sample} deleteHandler={action('Delete confirmed') }/>
));

storiesOf("Contact List App/Contact List", module)
.addDecorator(story => (
  <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>{story()}</MemoryRouter>
))
.add("default", () => { 
  const samples = [sample, sample, sample, sample, sample]
  return <ContactList contacts={samples}/>
});
~~~
The addDecorator() method wraps our custom component (e.g. Contact) inside a React framework component. The MemoryRouter component is a simple replacement for the Router component that will be required in the app itself - see later.

In the same file, replace the 'sample' const declaration with the following:

~~~
const sample = {
  name: {first:'Joe', last:'Bloggs'},
  location: {
    street: "ljan terrasse 346",
    city: "vear",
    state: "rogaland",
    postcode: "3095",
    coordinates: {
      latitude: "54.8646",
      longitude: "-97.3136"
    },
    timezone: {
      offse: "-10:00",
      description: "Hawaii"
    }
  },
    "login": {
      "uuid": "c4168eac-84b8-46ea-b735-c9da9bfb97fd",
      "username": "bluefrog786",
      "password": "ingrid",
      "salt": "GtRFz4NE",
      "md5": "5c581c5748fc8c35bd7f16eac9efbb55",
      "sha1": "c3feb8887abed9ec1561b9aa2c9f58de21d1d3d9",
      "sha256": "684c478a98b43f1ef1703b35b8bbf61b27dbc93d52acd515e141e97e04447712"
    },
    "dob": {
      "date": "1975-11-12T06:34:44Z",
      "age": 42
    },
    "registered": {
      "date": "2015-11-04T22:09:36Z",
      "age": 2
    },
  email: 'j.bloggs@example.com',
  phone: '012-3456789',
  picture: {thumbnail: './profile.png',
  large: './profile.png'}
}
~~~

We will be using some extra icons from Font Awesome in the new page. Replace the content of `src/fontawesome.js` with the following:

~~~
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import {
  faEnvelope,
  faPhone,
  faHome,
  faBirthdayCake,
  faArrowCircleLeft
} from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

library.add(faEnvelope, faPhone, faHome, faBirthdayCake, faArrowCircleLeft);
~~~

Finally, we also need a utility function to capitalize multi-word strings, for example, an address. Create the file `src/util.js` and add the following:

~~~
export function capitalize(string) 
{
    return string.replace(/\w\S*/g, function(txt){
        return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();
    });
}
~~~

Go to the `twoApps/contactList` folder and commit this work:

     $ git add -A
     $ git commit -m "Routing setup completed"
