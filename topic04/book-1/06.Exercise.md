## Exercise.

Objective: In the Movie Details page, display the red heart icon in the page header if the movie was tagged as a favourite.

![][exercise]

Due to the deficiencies in the favourite tagging logic (explained earlier), you should use the following procedure to check your solution works:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Tag any movie as a favourite.
1. Navigate to that movie's details page by using the 'More Info' link. The red heart should appear in the header.
1. Navigate back to the home page. (The favourites are lost, as before)
1. Navigate to any movie's details page. No red heart should display.

The only file you need to edit to complete this exercise is `components/headerMovie/index.js. Below is an outline of the solution:


~~~
. . . .  other imports . . . . 
import Avatar from "@mui/material/Avatar";
import FavoriteIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Favorite";


const MovieHeader = (props) => {
  const movie = props.movie;
  const favouriteMovies = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("favourites")); 
  . . . . . . . TODO . . . . . . . 

  return (
       . . . . . . . . . . . .
      <IconButton aria-label="go back">
        <ArrowBackIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
      </IconButton>

      { 
          . . . . . . display the Avatar with an embedded FavoriteIcon or null depending on some condition test. Use the ternary operator to express this, i.e. condition test ? true case : false case
      }
      <Typography variant="h4" component="h3">
        {movie.title}
          . . . . . . . . 
      </Typography>
      . . . . . . . . . . 
  );
};

export default MovieHeader;
