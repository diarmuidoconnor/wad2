## Contact List App (Contd.).

### Storybook addons.

The Contact component above expects a function prop. Storybook can accommodate this by providing a stub replacement, using an 'addon' to implement the stub.  Add the following line to the configuration file `.storybook/addons.js`:
~~~
import '@storybook/addon-actions/register';
 ~~~
 [See devDependencies section in `package.json`.]

 In `stories/index.js` add a new import at the top:
~~~
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';
~~~
and update the related story:
 ~~~
storiesOf("Contact List App/Contact", module).add("default", () => ( 
        <Contact contact={sample} deleteHandler={action('Delete confirmed') }/>
));
 ~~~
We are passing a dummy function (or action ) to the component. The dummy will simply display a message when invoked.  Start the Storybook server, select the Contact component, click the Delete button, followed by the Confirm:

![][delete]

Stop Storybook and start the CRA development server (npm start). Delete a contact and notice the Header badge is decremented. When a delete is confirmed, the Contact component calls the App component which in turn calls the stub API to delete the record fron the contacts array. App then calls *setState()* which causes the *render()* method to execute. In render we call *api.getAll()* which returns the updated array and renders it.

Commit these changes to git:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Updated Storybook for Delete"
~~~

[ The re-rendering by the App component does lead to some unnecessary re-rendering by the individual Contact components. We will remove this unnecessary execution later.]
