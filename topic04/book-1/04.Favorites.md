## Tagging favourite movies.

On the Home page, we can tag a movie as one of our favourites by clicking its 'Favorite' icon. This tagging will cause the related card to show a red Favorite Icon on the title bar. As a temporary solution, we will record a tagging by adding a 'favourite' property to the movie object and set it to true. But realistically, they should be persisted to a database via an API. 

![][favorites]

We will again use the inverse data flow (Data down, Action up) pattern, this time to handle when a user tags a movie as a favourite. We record this fact by adding a 'favourite' property to the movie object and set it to true. In `pages/homePage.js`, make the following changes to the component:
~~~js
..... as before ......

const MovieListPage = (props) => {
  ..... as before .......

  const addToFavourites = (movieId) => {
    const updatedMovies = movies.map((m) =>
      m.id === movieId ? { ...m, favourite: true } : m
    );
    setMovies(updatedMovies);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    ..... as before .....
  }
  ..........
~~~
and replace the line:
~~~js
   <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} />
~~~
with this:
~~~js
    <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} selectFavourite={addToFavourites} />
~~~
In `components/movieList/indes.js`, replace the line:
~~~js
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} />
~~~
with this:
~~~js
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} selectFavourite={props.selectFavourite} />
~~~
In `components/movieCard/index.js`, add an event handler:
~~~js
export default function MovieCard(props) {
  ..... as before .......

  const handleAddToFavourite = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.selectFavourite(movie.id);
  };

  return (
    ......as before .....
~~~
and replace the line:
~~~js
    <CardHeader className={classes.header} title={movie.title} />
~~~
with this:
~~~js
     <CardHeader
        avatar={
          movie.favourite ? (
            <Avatar sx={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>
              <FavoriteIcon />
            </Avatar>
          ) : null
        }
        title={
          <Typography variant="h5" component="p">
            {movie.title}{" "}
          </Typography>
        }
      />
~~~
And add an import statement on top:
~~~js
import Avatar from '@mui/material/Avatar';
~~~

[So far, component props have either been data objects or callback functions. However, as illustrated in the title and avatar props above, a component can also be a prop. We will also develop custom components that accept other components as props.]

In the same file, replace the lines:
~~~js
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favourites" onClick={null}>
      <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~
with this:
~~~js
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favourites" onClick={handleAddToFavourite}>
        <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~

The runtime execution flow resulting in the above changes is:
1. On the Home page, the user clicks a movie card's favourite icon.
1. The event handler invokes the callback provided by the HomePage. 
1. The callback sets the movie's favourite property to true - a state change. 
1. This state change causes the HomePage to re-render. 
1. The tagged MovieCard displays a (red) Favorite icon in its title because the associate movie object has the favourite property set to true.   

Try selecting some movies as your favourites.

We need a new view to display the list of favourites. Its layout will be identical to the home page. Implementing this without violating the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) will require some refactoring - see next section. As a placeholder, create the file `src/pages/favouriteMoviesPage.js` and add this code:
~~~js
import React from "react";

const favouriteMoviesPage = () => {
    return <h2>Favourite Movies</h2>
}

export default favouriteMoviesPage
~~~
We must update the routing configuration and, for convenience, add a simple site navigation bar as well. In `src/index.js`, replace the App component as illustrated below:
~~~js
.... other imports .....
import favouriteMoviesPage from "./pages/favouriteMoviesPage"; // NEW

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/movies/favourites">Favourites</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Routes>
        <Route exact path="/movies/favourites" element={<favouriteMoviesPage />} />
        <Route path="/movies/:id" element={<MoviePage />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={ <Navigate to="/" /> } />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

const rootElement = createRoot( document.getElementById("root") )
rootElement.render(<App /> );
~~~
Whenever we nake routing configuration changes, we must restart the development server:
~~~bash
$ npm start
~~~
In the browser, check the new navigation links at the top left are working.

The app has a bug! Try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favorites' icon of the first three movies.
1. Notice, the selected movies are tagged as expected. 
1. Go to the favourites page, using the navigation links on top
1. Navigate back to the Home page. The three selected movies are no longer tagged. This reset happened because the useEffect hook queries the API every time the home page component is mounted, i.e. we overwrite the tagged movies information. We will fix this issue in the next lab - I promise!

Commit this work to the repository:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Add to favourites logic completed; Dummy favourites page."
