## Using Live Movie Data.

[ You will need an API key for the TMDB service to complete this section - see the previous lab for details.]

We want the HomePage to request live movie data from the API. In `src/pages/homePage.js` make the changes shown below:
~~~
import React, {useState, useEffect } from "react";
. . . . other imports . . . . . 

const MovieListPage = () => {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&page=1`
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => {
        console.log(json)
        return json.results
      })
      .then(movies => {
        setMovies(movies);
      });
  }, []);
  return (
    <>
    . . . . as before . . . . 
    </>
  );
};

export default MovieListPage;
~~~

On saving the above changes the browser should be showing a list of current movie titles:

![][current]

In the above code the useEffect hook is querying the `Discovery` endpoint of the API for a set of current movies (read more [here][discovery] ). The URL includes a query string:

>?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&page=1

The api_key attribute is used to authenticate the HTTP request. The page attribute indicates the subset of movies being requested. It can range from 1 to 1000, where 1 means the first 20 movies, 2 means movies 21 to 40, and so on. We have hard-coded it to page 1 for convenience.

Note the last 'then clause' in the fetch call:
~~~
.then(movies => {
    setMovies(movies);
});
~~~
It stores the web API's response in a state variable called *movies* - created by the useState hook. 

The second then clause of the fetch has a console.log statement as an aid to understanding the structure of the response returned by the API. Open the developer tools in the browser and examine the output from the log statement:

![][structure]

Take some time to explore the content of the response's *results* property.

In `src/components/movieCard/index.js` make two changes:

+ Wrap the img tag in a Link, as follows
~~~
  <Link to={`/movies/${props.movie.id}`}>
    <img
      className="card-img-tag center "
      alt={props.movie.title}
      src={
        props.movie.poster_path
          ? `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${props.movie.poster_path}`
          : "./film-poster-placeholder.png"
      }
    />
  </Link>
~~~

+ Add an import at the top of the file:
~~~
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
~~~

This code modification means clicking a movie poster image will cause the browser's URL address to change, for example:

> http://localhost:3000/movies/475557

This URL pattern will match the first Route in the app's routing configuration (see `src/index.js`):
~~~
 <Route path="/movies/:id" component={MoviePage} />
~~~
The id parameter in the path will be bound to the id property of the clicked movie, e.g. 475557. The Route causes the app's Movie Details page to render. That page's logic must requests the movie's details from the TMDB API - previously we passed in the details as a prop but this was a temporary solution.

In `src/pages/movieDetailsPage.js`, make the following modifications:
~~~
import React, {useState, useEffect}  from "react";
. . . . other imports . . . . .

const MoviePage = props => {
  const { id } = props.match.params
  const [movie, setMovie] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${id}?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}`
    ).then(res => res.json())    
    .then(movie => {
      setMovie(movie);
    })
  }, [id])

  return (
    <>
    . . . . as before . . . 
    </>
  );
};
~~~
The statement:

>const { id } = props.match.params

allows the component extract the clicked movie's id from the browser URL address. The useEffect hook uses the API's movie endpoint (read more [here][movie]) to get the full details on the movie. In the browser, click any of the movie posters displayed on the Home page. You should now see the details page for that movie:

![][detailp]

In the Home page, the list of genres in the filtering dropdown is  hard-coded. Now we can populate the list from the API's genre endpoint (read more [here][genres]). It returns an array of objects, for example:
~~~
[
  {
    id: '"1",
    name: "Action"
  },
  {
    id: '"2",
    name: "Adventure"
  },  {
    id: '"3",
    name: "Animation"
  },
  . . . etc . . . . 
]
~~~
The 'all genres' option is not included in the array returned by the API; we must add it manually, By assigning it an id of zero we avoid a clash with any other genre id.

In `src/components/filterControls/index.js`, completely replace the current code with the following:
~~~
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import "./filterControls.css";

const FilterControls = props => {
  const [genres, setGenres] = useState([{ id: '0', name: "All" }])
 
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list?api_key=" +
        process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY
    )
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => json.genres)
      .then(apiGenres => {
        setGenres([genres[0], ...apiGenres]);
      });
  }, []);

  const handleChange = (e, type, value) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    // Completed in a later lab
  };
  const handleTextChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "name", e.target.value)
  }
  const handleGenreChange = e => {
    handleChange(e, "genre", e.target.value)
  };

  return (
      <div className="row bg-warning">
        <div className="col-md-12">
          <h4>
            <span>List Filtering:</span>
            <input
              type="text"
              placeholder="Title Search"
              onChange={handleTextChange}
            />
          <select id="genre" onChange={handleGenreChange}>
              {genres.map(genre => {
                return (
                  <option key={genre.id} value={genre.id}>
                    {genre.name}
                  </option>
                );
              })}
          </select>
         </h4>
        </div>
      </div>
  );
}

export default FilterControls;
~~~
The event handling logic for the input fields above is incomplete for now. In the useEffect hook we set the *genres* state variable by creating a new array comprised of:

1. The first entry in the current state variable array - genres[0], and
2. The array returned by the API - apiGenres. The Javascript spread operator (...) is used to copy one array into another.

In the browser, check the genre dropdown is showing the full list of options.
