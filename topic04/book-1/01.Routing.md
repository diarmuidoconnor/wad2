## Routing.

Initially the app will support two routes:

+ / (root path) - this will match the Home page, which shows a list of movies from the TMDB API.
+ /movies/:id (a parameterized route) - this will match the Movie Details page, where the id parameter (Movie ID) is used to retrieve the relevant movie details from the API.

In general, the top component in an app's component hierarchy is primarily concerned with routing. In `src/index.js` replace the entire content with the following code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Redirect, Switch} from "react-router-dom";
import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";
import MoviePage from './pages/movieDetailsPage'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div className="jumbotron">
        <div className="container-fluid">
          <Switch>
            <Route path="/movies/:id" component={MoviePage} />
            <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
            <Redirect from="*" to="/" />
          </Switch>
        </div>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

Our code will throw an error in the browser, which will be resolved shortly.
