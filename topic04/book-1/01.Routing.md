## Routing.

Initially, the app will support two routes:

+ / (root path) - this will match the Home page, which shows a list of movies from the TMDB API.
+ /movies/:id (a parameterized route) - this will match the Movie Details page, where we use the id parameter (Movie ID) to retrieve the relevant movie details from the API.

In general, the top component in an app's component hierarchy is concerned with routing. In `src/index.js`, replace the entire content with the following code:
~~~js
import React from "react";
import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Navigate, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";
import MoviePage from "./pages/movieDetailsPage";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/movies/:id" element={<MoviePage />} />
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={ <Navigate to="/" /> } />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

const rootElement = createRoot( document.getElementById("root") )
rootElement.render(<App /> );
~~~
These changes will break our app temporarily, but you may continue anyway.
