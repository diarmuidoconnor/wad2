## Contact List App (Contd.).

### The Delete feature.

A delete is initiated in a Contact component, however, it effects the Header component badge and must also be communicated to the Stub API. The App component should coordinate this logic. The elements of the solution includes:

+ A function in App to communicate with the API and perform re-rendering of the Header.
+ Pass a reference to above function to the Contact components. 
+ Contact component invokes the function when required. 

In `src/App.js`, make the following changes:
~~~
class App extends Component {
    ...... other code ......
    deleteContact = (key) => {
        api.delete(key); 
        this.setState({});                          
    };
    render() {
        . . . . as before . .  .
        return (
            . . . as before . . . 
            <ContactList contacts={contacts} 
                    deleteHandler={this.deleteContact} />
            . . . as before . . . 
    );
}
}
      export default App;
~~~
In `components/contactList/index.js` make the following changes:
~~~
export default class ContactList extends Component {
    render() {
    const contactCards = this.props.contacts.map(c => (
    <Contact
        key={c.phone}
        contact={c}
        deleteHandler={this.props.deleteHandler}
    />
    )); 
    return (
        . . . . as before . . . .
        ) ;
    }
}
~~~
In `components/contact/index.js` make the additions shown:
~~~
class Contact extends Component {
    . . . . other handlers . . . . 
    handleDelete = () =>  this.setState({ status : 'del'} );
    handleConfirm = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.props.deleteHandler(this.state.phone);
    };
    render() { 
        . . . . existing statements . . . . . 
        if (this.state.status === 'edit' ) {
            . . . as before . . . 
        } else if (this.state.status === 'del' ) {
        cardColor = "bg-warning";
        activeButtons = buttons.delete;
        leftButtonHandler = this.handleCancel;
        rightButtonHandler = this.handleConfirm;
    }
    return ( . . . as before . . . )   
}
export default Contact;
~~~
Note, for convenience we are using a contact's phone number as a unique identifier. We will test this code in the next section.
