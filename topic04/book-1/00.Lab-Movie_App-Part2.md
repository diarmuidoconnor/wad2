# Developing a Movies Fan App.

In this lab we will enhance the static Movies Fan app from the previous lab session. 

The features added will include:

1. Live data retrieved from the TMDB API.
1. Navigation.
1. Filtering of the movie list displayed on the home page.
1. The ability to add a movie to your favorites list.
 
From a technical perspective this will involve using:

1. The useState and useEffect hooks.
1. The React-Router module.

>>### Please ensure you maintain a Git repository throughout the development of this app. You should submit all the 'git commit' commands specified in this and subsequent labs. A log of the repository commit history will be used in the assessment of your lab work for this module
