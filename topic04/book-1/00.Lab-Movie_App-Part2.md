### This lab is part of the continuous assessment element of the Web App Dev 2 module. You must follow the exact Git commit commands included in the instructions, as we use them in the assessment process. You will also be pushing to GitHub regularly - to the same repository you created in the previous lab.
You are expected to complete the work promptly, which also feeds into the assessment process.
