# Developing a Movies Fan App.

In this lab, we will enhance the static Movies Fan app from the previous lab session. 

The features we will add are:

1. Live data retrieved from the TMDB API.
1. Navigation.
1. Filtering of the movie list displayed on the home page.
1. Tagging your favourite movies.
 
From a technical perspective, this will involve using:

1. The useState and useEffect hooks.
1. The React-Router module.
