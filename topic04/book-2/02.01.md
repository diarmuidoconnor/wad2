## Hacker News.

### Stub API

Again we will use a stub API as the model data source. Create the file `hackerNews/src/dataStore/stubAPI.js` and paste in the following code:

~~~
import _ from "lodash";

class StubAPI {
	constructor() {
		this.posts = [
		{
			id: 1,
			title: "Why You Can No Longer Get Lost in the Crowd",
			link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/opinion/data-privacy.html",
			author: "Woodrow Hartzog",
			comments: [],
			upvotes: 10
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			title: "Samsung's folding phone breaks for reviewers",
			link: "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47970788",
			author: "Dave Lee",
			comments: [],

		},
		{
			id: 3,
			title:
			"Microsoft turned down facial-recognition sales on human rights concerns",
			link: null,
			author: "Joseph Mennn",
			comments: [],
			upvotes: 12
		},
		{
			id: 4,
			title:
			"Follow-up: I found two identical packs of Skittles, among 468 packs with a total of 27,740 Skittles",

		},
		{

			author: "MIKE DAVIS",

		},
		{
			id: 6,
			title: "Sleep myths 'damaging your health'",
			link: "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47937405",
			author: "James Gallagher",
			comments: [],
			upvotes: 10
		},
		{
			id: 7,
			title: "Planetâ€™s ocean-plastics problem detailed in 60-year data set",
			link: "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01252-0",

			comments: [],
			upvotes: 20
		}
		];
	}

	getAll() {
		return this.posts;
	}

	add(title, author, link) {
		let id = 1;
		let last = _.last(this.posts);
		if (last) {
		id = last.id + 1;
		}
		let len = this.posts.length;
		let newLen = this.posts.push({
		id,
		title,
		author,
		link,
		comments: [],
		upvotes: 0
		});
		return newLen > len;
	}

	upvote(id) {
		let index = _.findIndex(this.posts, post => post.id === id);
		if (index !== -1) {
		this.posts[index].upvotes += 1;
		return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	getPost(id) {
		let index = _.findIndex(this.posts, post => post.id === id);
		let result = index !== -1 ? this.posts[index] : null;
		return result;
	}

	addComment(postId, c, n) {
		let post = this.getPost(postId);
		let id = 1;
		let last = _.last(post.comments);
		if (last) {
		id = last.id + 1;
		}
		post.comments.push({ id: id, comment: c, author: n, upvotes: 0 });
	}

	upvoteComment(postId, commentId) {
		let post = this.getPost(postId);
		let index = _.findIndex(post.comments, c => c.id === commentId);
		if (index !== -1) {
		post.comments[index].upvotes += 1;
		}
	}
}

export default new StubAPI();
~~~
Note: An __id__ has been added to each post (news item) object for convenience. The add method of the API computes the id of a new post by simply incrementing the id of the last one in the array. The upvote method is passed the id of the post to be upvoted.

In `src/App.js` completely replace the current code with the following:
~~~
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import NewsList from './components/newsList/';
import Form from './components/newsForm/';
import api from './dataStore/stubAPI';

export default class App extends Component {    
	render() {
		let posts =  api.getAll();
		return (
			<div className="jumbotron">
			<div className="container-fluid">
			<div className="row">
				<div className="col-md-6 offset-3">
					<h1><a href="/">Hacker News</a></h1>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div className="row">
				<div className="col-md-4 ">
					<Form />
				</div>
				<div className="col-md-8">
					<NewsList posts={posts} />
				</div>
			</div>	
		</div>	
		</div>	
		);
	}
}
~~~
Start the development server (npm start). The browser should render the app as before.

From the `twoapps/contactlist` folder update the local Git repo:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added stub API"
