# User Mongoose Schema

With Mongoose we declare the object structure (or schema) for each collection in the database. In your Express app directory, create a directory */api/users/* and create the file *userModel.js* containing the following code:

```javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true},
  password: {type: String, required: true }
});

export default mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Schema is a constructor function provided by Mongoose for creating schema instances (in this case, ``UserSchema``). The last line of code above associates the schema instance with a database collection named 'User' (MongoDB creates unknown collections automatically, if necessary). The ``model()`` method returns a model object, which has special methods for querying and manipulating the associated collection, e.g. ``find()``, ``findById()``, ``create()`` etc.
