# MongoDB Setup

![Mongoose](./img/download.png)

You need to create a MongoDB in one of two forms: Installed Locally or Cloud-based. This lab was developed using a **Local MongoDb**: 


### Local MongoDB
If you want to use a local db running on your laptop, do the following:

+ Download and install Mongodb by selecting the relevant installer for your OS: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community

Follow the instructions and accept all defaults.

Open the  command line in the directory where you want to put your db directory and enter the following commands:

```bash
mkdir db
mongod -dbpath db
```

This should create your db directory and start the Mongodb service on your local host.

- Add the **mongoDb URL** to the end of your ``.env`` file in the root folder of the express app. 

```bash
mongoDB=mongodb://localhost:27017/movies_db
```

### Mongoose

+ Install Mongoose in your lab project directory for the Express app (**DONT** install it in the React app directory) 

```bash
npm install -save mongoose
```


## OPTIONAL STEP: Mongo Cloud

If you want to use Mongo "in the cloud", see the appendix in the Exercises step.

## Commit your changes

- Commit the changes you have just made using git.

~~~bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Week 9 Added Mongo"
~~~
