# Appendix
## OPTIONAL STEP: Mongo Cloud

If you want to use Mongo "in the cloud", do the following:

- Go to  https://cloud.mongodb.com/

![MongoDB Cloud](./img/cloud.png)

- create a free tier cluster in Amazon Ireland Region. *Follow the instructions for a free tier **
- Make sure to follow all the steps to create the cluster. Once complete, get the connection string for your MongoDB as shown below:

- It is risky to have configuration parameters such as user-names, passwords, and instance specific parameters "hard coded" into your javascript programs. In this exercise you will externalise these parameters into the ".env" file. Add the **mongoDb connection string** to the end of your ``.env`` file in the root folder of the express app. 

```bash
mongoDB=mongodb+srv://....
```
