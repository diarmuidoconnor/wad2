# Error Handling with Promises

Unfortunately with Express, if a Promise is rejected **and not handled**, execution of the "middleware stack" will stop and a response will not be sent. The client will be left hanging. This will occur even if you have error handler middleware. 

To demonstrate this, do the following:
- Using Postman, make a request to the API  for movie reviews using the following URL ``localhost:8080/api/movies/682377/reviews``. You'll notice that Postman will "hang" and you will see the following at the console:
```
(node:18624) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: FetchError: request to https://api.themovied.org/3/movie/682377/reviews?api_key=bd3463bcfdc49dc12c7084fc59af4405 failed,....
```

This occurred because the URL is not correct in ``getMovieReviews`` in */api/tmdb-api.js* (I left out the 'b' in moviedb on purpose!).**Don't fix it yet!**  
This simulates what would happen if the TMDB-API went offline. 
APIs should deal gracefully with any errors and return an appropriate response. They should not "hang" or "freeze"

In this section we will create a generic error handler function that we can use to handle promise rejections.


- Open */api/movies/index.js* and update the ``/:id/reviews`` route to the following:
```javascript
router.get('/:id/reviews', (req, res, next) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  getMovieReviews(id)
  .then(reviews => res.status(200).send(reviews))
  .catch((error) => next(error));
});
```

Adding the ``.catch(..)`` catches and uses ``next(error)`` to pass the error on the next error handler in the middleware stack. 
- Make the same request again. Your HTTP Client (Postman) should now return the following:  
![](./img/fail.png)

Now you are are getting a response and the client is not "hanging". However you will notice the error also includes the private Key for the TMDB database which should be kept secret (this is a technique that can be used to get private keys from poorly designed APIs). To fix this, we can include Error handling middleware in our Express app.

- Open */index.js*, the main entry point for the app, and add the following function **before you assign the ``app`` constant**:  
```javascript
const errHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  /* if the error in development then send stack trace to display whole error,
  if it's in production then just send error message  */
  if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    return res.status(500).send(`Something went wrong!`);
  }
  res.status(500).send(`Hey!! You caught the error üëçüëç, ${err.stack} `);
};
```

- Then, to handle all errors, add the following line of code to the bottom of the middleware stack(i.e. after the last ``app.use(..)`` statement )
```javascript
app.use(errHandler);
```
- Now run the same request again for ``localhost:8080/api/movies/682377/reviews``. This time you should see the following:
![](./img/handler.png)
You still see the API key however, if this was in production, you would just see the message "Something went wrong". Test this by setting ``NODE_ENV`` to "production" in the *.env*.

## Exercise

- Fix the URL error for ``getMovieReviews`` in */api/tmdb-api.js*
- Handle other potential Promise rejections by add the same ``.catch(..)`` to the other routes in *./api/movies/index.js*
