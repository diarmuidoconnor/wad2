# MongoDB Setup

![Mongoose](./img/download.png)

You need to create a MongoDB in one of two forms: Installed Locally or Cloud-based. This lab was developed using a **Local MongoDb**: 


### Local MongoDB
If you want to use a local db running on your laptop, do the following:

+ Download and install Mongodb by selecting the relevant installer for your OS: [https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

Follow the instructions and accept all defaults.

Open the  command line in the directory where you want to put your db directory and enter the following commands:

```bash
mkdir db
mongod -dbpath db
```

This should create your db directory and start the Mongodb service on your local host.


## OPTIONAL STEP: Mongo Cloud

If you want to use Mongo "in the cloud", see the appendix in the Exercises step.
