# Mongoose

This lab introduces Mongoose, a simple way of interacting with your Mongo database.

In this lab you will develop:
- Create an API for managing API users
- A ``/api/users`` route to allow users to basic authentication.
- Express-Sessions package to manage/track user session
- Authentication middleware to block access to the ``/api/users`` for unauthenticated users.
- Update the User model to use referencing.
