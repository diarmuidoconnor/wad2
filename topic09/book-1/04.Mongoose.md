# Connect the Database

You should only need to connect to the Mongo database once, when your Express application starts

- Open the file */.env* and add the following
```
MONGO_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/movies_db
```


+ In the **root directory** of your express app, create a new file called ``db.js`` with the following contents:

```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

dotenv.config();

// Connect to database
mongoose.connect(process.env.mongoDB);
const db = mongoose.connection;

db.on('error', (err) => {
    console.log(`database connection error: ${err}`);
});
db.on('disconnected', () => {
    console.log('database disconnected');
});
db.once('open', () => {
    console.log(`database connected to ${db.name} on ${db.host}`);
})
```

+ Add the following line to the import statements at the top of ``index.js`` in the root folder of your Express app.

~~~javascript
import './db';
....
~~~

This will automatically trigger the connection to the database when the app starts up. 
When the Express App reloads, you should see output at the command line as following:

```
Server running at 8080
database connected to movies_db on localhost

```

## Create User Mongoose Schema

With Mongoose we declare the object structure (or schema) for each collection in the database. In your Express app directory, create a directory */api/users/* and create the file *userModel.js* containing the following code:

```javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  username: { type: String, unique: true, required: true},
  password: {type: String, required: true }
});

export default mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Schema is a constructor function provided by Mongoose for creating schema instances (in this case, ``UserSchema``). The last line of code above associates the schema instance with a database collection named 'User' (MongoDB creates unknown collections automatically, if necessary). The ``model()`` method returns a model object, which has special methods for querying and manipulating the associated collection, e.g. ``find()``, ``findById()``, ``create()`` etc.

## Load User Data to MongoDB

When the app starts, it would be good to 'seed' the DB with data. This will help with development and testing of functionality as we go forward (it would be switched off for production of course) 
Include a ``SEED_DB`` property in *.env* file to indicate if we wish to seed the database with data. 

```bash
SEED_DB=true
```

+ Create a folder called *seedData* in the root folder of the Express app.
+ In the *seedData* folder, create a new file called ``index.js``  and enter the following code:

```javascript
import userModel from '../api/users/userModel';

const users = [
  {
    'username': 'user1',
    'password': 'test1',
  },
  {
    'username': 'user2',
    'password': 'test2',
  },
];

// deletes all user documents in collection and inserts test data
export async function loadUsers() {
  console.log('load user Data');
    try {
      await userModel.deleteMany();
      await userModel.collection.insertMany(users);
      console.info(`${users.length} users were successfully stored.`);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(`failed to Load user Data: ${err}`);
    }
  }
```

The ``loadUsers()`` function exported from the above script will initialise the database with the users data we used in the previous labs.  
**NOTE:** instead of Promises, a different approach of asynchronous programming is used in the above code: **Async-Await**. For more info see the course notes and have a look at https://medium.com/better-programming/understanding-async-await-in-javascript-1d81bb079b2c

+ Add the following code to ``index.js`` in the root folder of your Express app.

```javascript
import {loadUsers} from './seedData'

....

if (process.env.SEED_DB) {
  loadUsers();
}
....
```

All going well, when the server restarts it should report the successful insertion of User data on the console: 

```
Server running at 8080
database connected to movies_db on localhost
(node:1356) DeprecationWarning: collection.ensureIndex is deprecated. Use createIndexes instead.
2 users were successfully stored.
```
