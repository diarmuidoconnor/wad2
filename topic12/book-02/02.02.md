# Generate a Signed Certificate



+ As before, generate a 4096-bit RSA private key and Certificate Sign Request. This time it's for the Express Server App

  ~~~
  openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -keyout expressApp.key -out expressApp.csr
  ~~~

  As before, make up some fake info about the Express App (), e.g. Organization Name of "Finest Express Apps Ltd")

  ### Generate and sign the Web Server Certificate 

This is where we pretend to be a CA authority. In the real world, you would submit the certificate signing request to a CA (for example https://letsencrypt.org/). The exact steps differ among certificate authorities, and some CAs have videos or written instructions to guide you through the process. It usually involves the following steps:

1. Upload your CSR through the web management console.
2. After a few days, the signed certificate will be available for you to download and install into your server.

We will emulate that process: 

+ Get your Certificate Authority , using its private key, to sign the serverâ€™s CSR file:



~~~
openssl x509 -req -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -in expressApp.csr -out expressApp.crt
~~~

We now have a signed cert for our express app. The next step is to configure the Express App to use the private key and cert
