# The Module System

Node.js provides a simple module system that lets you structure your program into different files. In our *index.js* example, we use the core http module to create our HTTP service. You can also write your own modules. When creating a module, this can be interpreted as moving all related functions into a file.

- Create a new file called *greeting.js* in the *node-lab1* folder with the following content:  

~~~javascript
const greeting = {
    en: "Hello World!",
    fr: "Bonjour!"
};

export default greeting;
~~~

- Update your *index.js* file as follows:

~~~javascript
// Load the http module to create an http server.
import http from 'http';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import greeting from './greeting.js';

dotenv.config();
const port = process.env.PORT;

// Configure our HTTP server to respond with Hello World to all requests.
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  let lang = req.headers['accept-language'];
  const defaultLang='en';
  if (!greeting[lang]) lang=defaultLang;
  const response={
    lang: lang,
    message: greeting[lang],
  };

  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
                      'Content-Language': response.lang});
  res.end(response.message);
});

server.listen(port);

// Put a friendly message on the terminal
console.log(`Server running at ${port}`);
~~~

Now test your file again using a browser. The ``export`` statement exposes greeting to other modules that require it. To access the exported functions in our simple server, we can load the greeting module using the require function in ``import greeting from ('./greeting');``. The server gets the accepted language from the requesting process using ``req.headers["accept-language"]``. The "accept-language" header is set by your browser and will default to your locale. If you want to change the value of http headers, you can use a API testing application like Postman

## API Testing using Postman

Postman is currently one of the most popular tools used in API testing. This lab will opt for [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).


- Install the Postman desktop agent from the link above.
- Return to Postman in the browser and create a new workspace called "WAD2".
- Perform a **HTTP GET** request to **localhost:8080** with ``Accept-language=fr`` as follows:  
1. In the *Request Window, Enter **localhost:8080**
2. Select the *Headers* Tab
3. Enter *Accept-Language* as a key and *fr* as value
4. Click Send

You should see the French representation for the greeting returned in the response.

As you will see, using the core modules in Node.js gives you very few modules. Most of the real power in Node.js is contained in the third party modules available through the Node Package Management system(NPM).
