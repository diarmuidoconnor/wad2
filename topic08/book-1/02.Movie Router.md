## Routing using Express

Express gives us an easy way of mapping specific URL paths to Javascript functions. We want to create the following API for now:



### Express Movies Router

- Create a new folder called **api** in **movies-api**. Create another folder called **movies** in **api**. Your folder structure should look as follows:  

~~~
+movies-api
    |-api
       |-movies
~~~

We will use test data for the time being. 

- Create a new file called **movies.js** in the */api/movies* folder and add the following code:  

~~~javascript
export const moviesObject = {
    "movies": [
      {
        "title": "The Avengers",
        "poster_path": "/cezWGskPY5x7GaglTTRN4Fugfb8.jpg",
        "overview": "When an unexpected enemy emerges and threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins!",

        "genre_ids": [
          878,
          28,
          12
        ],
        "id": 24428,
        "original_title": "The Avengers",
        "original_language": "en",
        "backdrop_path": "/hbn46fQaRmlpBuUrEiFqv0GDL6Y.jpg",
        "popularity": 7.353212,
        "vote_count": 8503,
        "video": false,
        "vote_average": 7.33
      },
      {
        "title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron",
        "poster_path": "/t90Y3G8UGQp0f0DrP60wRu9gfrH.jpg",
        "adult": false,
        "overview": "When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earthâ€™s Mightiest Heroes are put to the ultimate test as the fate of the planet hangs in the balance. As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for an epic and unique global adventure.",
        "release_date": "2015-04-22",
        "genre_ids": [
          28,
          12,
          878
        ],
        "id": 99861,
        "original_title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron",
        "original_language": "en",
        "backdrop_path": "/570qhjGZmGPrBGnfx70jcwIuBr4.jpg",
        "popularity": 7.557812,
        "vote_count": 3924,
        "video": false,
        "vote_average": 7.4
      }
    ]
  }
~~~
In the absence of a database, this module exports a movie object that we can use to develop and test the api.

- Also in the movies folder, create a new file called **index.js** and enter the following javascript:

~~~javascript
import express from 'express';
import {moviesObject} from './movies';

const router = express.Router(); // eslint-disable-line

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(moviesObject);
});

export default router;
~~~

- Now update **index.js** in the root folder to use the new movies routing script by replacing the contents with the following code

~~~javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import express from 'express';
import moviesRouter from './api/movies';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT;

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use('/api/movies', moviesRouter);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Server running at ${port}`);
});
~~~

- Now test the application again by doing a HTTP GET on ``localhost:8080/api/movies`` using Postman. You should see something simlilar to the following:  
![Get contact details](./img/movies.png)

Locate and record the "id" property of one of the movies for the next section.

## Get a Movie By ID

We would like to be able to return the details of a single movie. Using our API design as a reference, we need to update the movies router script to handle a HTT GET request for a specific movie. The handling function will extract the movie ID from the ``req`` and use it to return the specific movie in the ``res``

+ In the router script (/api/movies/index.js), add the following code just above the ``export`` statement. 

~~~javascript
//get a movie
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const key =  parseInt(req.params.id);
  const index = moviesObject.movies.map((movie)=>{
return movie.id;
}).indexOf(key);
 if (index > -1) {
     res.status(200).send(moviesObject.movies[index]);
 } else {
   res.status(404).send({message: `Unable to find movie with id: ${key}.`, status: 404});
   }
});
~~~

Now make a request using the ``id`` you recorded in the last step. You should see the result similar to the following:  
![](./img/1.png)

Now try it **with a random id that doesn't exist in the list**. You should see the following result:

![](./img/2.png)
