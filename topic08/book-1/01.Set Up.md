# Express App

In this lab, we'll now move to Express.js, a richer web app package and provides a nice high level approach to serving up static content. It's based around the idea of creating an Express "app" that you can easily configure. One of the configuration options allows you to specify the location of your publicly available content such as static HTML, CSS, client-side Javascript files etc.

## Lab Set up

The initial set up of the express application is similar to the last lab.
+ Create a new folder in your git repository called *movies-api*
  ![](./img/mov.png)

+ Open a command line **in the movies-api folder**, run ``npm init``  and create a new Node project called "movies-api" (just accept all the default values:)  . Note:
```
package name: (movies-api)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author: YOUR_NAME/ID
license: (ISC)
```

+ Install the following development dependencies by running the following command in the *moves-api* folder:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-env nodemon eslint babel-eslint
```
The ``--save-dev`` flag will write the packages to the *devDependency* section in package.json.

+ Run the following command to install the normal app dependencies:

```
npm install --save dotenv express
```
The ``--save`` flag will write the packages to the normal  *dependency* section in package.json.

+ Copy ***.eslintrc, .env,* and *.babelrc*** files from last weeks lab and paste them into the ***movies-api*** folder.

+ Open *package.json*, and replace the *"scripts"* element with the following:

~~~
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec babel-node index.js"
  }
~~~

You're now ready to start developing an Express app!

## Express

- In your *movies-api* folder, create a new folder called *public*.
- In this folder, create a file called *index.html* with the following content:

~~~html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Movies API</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>The Movies API</h1>
    </body>

</html>
~~~

- In the *movies-api* folder, create a file called **index.js** with the following javascript:

~~~javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import express from 'express';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(`Server running at ${port}`);
});

~~~

- Now run the application by typing ``npm start`` at the command line **in the *movies-api* folder**. 
- Using Postman, go to *http://localhost:8080*. It should display the default resource (index.html) from the public folder.

You could also put the URL into a browser to see the HTML rendered.
