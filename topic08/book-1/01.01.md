# Set up

This lab continues from last weeks lab. If you have not completed last weeks lab you will need to do so.

If you don't have the last lab, it will eventually be available in the labs directory of the  [samples](https://github.com/fxwalsh/node-samples-2018.git) repository on GitHub.

Check it works as before by running:

```
npm start
```

### Get Mongo, Mongoose and Express Async Handler
![Mongoose](./img/download.png)
+ Download and install Mongodb by selecting the relevant installer for your OS:

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)

Follow the instructions and accept all defaults.

Open the  command line in the directory where you want to put your db directory and enter the following commands:

```bash
mkdir db
mongod -dbpath db
```

This should create your db directory and start the Mongodb service on your local host.

+ Install Mongoose in your lab project directory for the Express app (**DONT** install it in the React app directory) 

```bash
npm install -save mongoose
```

+ We will be using Mongoose with the async await pattern. To help us deal with rejected promises in Express, download the express-async-handler from NPM:

```bash
npm install -save express-async-handler
```
