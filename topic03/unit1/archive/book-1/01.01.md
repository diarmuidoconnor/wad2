## 1-way data flow.

Download and unzip [this archive][app] - it's the FilterFriends React app developed with the create-react-app tool. Open a terminal, go to the base folder (`1WayDataFlow`) and type:

~~~
$ npm install
~~~

Before running this app, we first need to setup a __mock__ Web API. The [json-server][json] utility is ideal for this requirement. Install it as follows:

~~~
$ npm install -g json-server
~~~

Create a file in the base folder (`1WayDataFlow`) named `friends.json` and paste in the JSON structure below:  

~~~
{
	"friends": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"name": "Joe Bloggs",
			"address": "1 Main Street",
			"email": "jbloggs@here.con"
		},
		{
			"id": 2,
			"name": "Paula Smith",
			"address": "5 High Street",
			"email": "psmith@here.con"
		},
		{
			"id": 3,
			"name": "Catherine Dwyer",
			"address": "2 Upper Street",
			"email": "cdwyer@here.con"
		},
		{
			"id": 4,
			"name": "Paul Briggs",
			"address": "3 Side Street",
			"email": "pbriggs@here.con"
		}
	]
}
~~~
From the base folder start the mock API server:

~~~
Â¢ json-server ./friends.json -p 3001
~~~

[ Note, the server is using port 3001.]

To prove the mock API is working, in the browser navigate to: http://localhost:3001/friends. The server will responds with the full list of friends. Try a HTTP request to:  http://localhost:3001/friends/2. This time the Web API returns the friend with an id of 2. Leave the API server running. 

Open a second terminal window, go to `1WayDataFlow`  and start the development server (provided by the create-react-app tool):

~~~
$ npm start
~~~

The app should be displaying the full list of friends retrieved from the API (see illustration). Use the search text box to find specific friends.

Examine the code in `src/App.js` and the `src/components` folder to ensure you understand how it works. Some features worth noting are: 

+ The FriendsApp component uses React's component state feature to store the current value of the text input field. They are always in sync.
+ The *componentDidMount* method in the *FriendsApp* component sends an __asynchronous__ HTTP Get request to the API server. It stores the responds (the full list of friends, as a JSON data structure) in the *localCache* custom object and then forces a re-rendering of the component by calling *setState()*.
+ The *render* method of *FriendsApp* computes the matching subset of friends, based on the current content of the input field.
+ The *onChange* event handler for the input field - the *filterFriends* function - also forces a re-rendering of its containing component, i.e. every time the user changes the text field the subset of matching friends must be recomputed and the display updated.
+ Sometimes a change to the input text field does not change the matching subset of friends. In this case their is no need to re-render the display. The *shouldComponentUpdate* method of the *FilteredFriendList* component fulfills this performance check.
