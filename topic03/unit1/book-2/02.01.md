## Contact List App.

### Setup.

In a terminal window, go to `twoApps/contactlist` folder and install the required packages:

        $ npm install

While the installation may report some warning messages, their should be zero security vulnerabilities.

### UI Design.

The desired UI for this app looks as follows:

![][contactsUI]

The proposed component breakdown for this UI is illustrated below:

![][contactsDesign]

Therefore the set of components are:

1. Header
1. Filter controls
1. List of contacts
1. A contact 

This breakdown maps to the following component hierarchy:

                       App (Default)
                        |
          -----------------------------
          |             |             |
         Header   FilterControls  ContactList
                                      |
                                   Contact

In the `src` folder create a new subfolder `components`. Inside this create the
 following file structure to support the above design:

![][contactfiles]

[contactsUI]: ./img/contactsUI.png
[contactsDesign]: ./img/contactsDesign.png
[contactfiles]: ./img/contactfiles.png
