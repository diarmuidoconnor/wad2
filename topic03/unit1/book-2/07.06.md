## Contact List App (Contd.).

### Assemble the App.

We now have all the components developed. It's time to assemble them in to an app. Stop the Storybook server and start the create-react-app development server:

      $ npm start

 Replace the entire content of `src/App.js` with the following:

~~~
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Header from "./components/header/";
import ContactList from "./components/contactList/";
import FilterControls from "./components/filterControls/";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    const sample = {
      name: { first: "Joe", last: "Bloggs" },
      email: "j.bloggs@example.com",
      phone: "012-3456789",
      picture: { thumbnail: "./profile.png" }
    };

    const contacts = [sample, sample, sample, sample, sample];

    return (
      <div className="jumbotron">
        <Header noContacts={10} />
        <FilterControls />
        <ContactList contacts={contacts} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
~~~

In `src/index.js` add a reference to the Bootstrap CSS library at the top:

~~~
import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
~~~

The browser should now be rendering a static version of the entire app. 

Their is one small bug. The badge in the header should show the number of contacts being displayed (this will change dynamically in a later lab) rather than hardcoded to a fixed number. __You are required__ to modify the code to achieve this. The result should look as follows:

![][contactsStatic]

On completion, in the terminal window, from the  `twoApps/contactlist` folder, type the following commands:

         $ git add -A
         $ git commit -m "Static version completed"

[contactsStatic]: ./img/contactsStatic.png
