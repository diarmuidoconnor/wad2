## Hacker News App.

### Setup.

In a terminal window, go to `twoApps/hackernews` folder and install the required packages:
 
    $ npm install

We will need FontAwesome in this app as well. Following the same approach as before, create the file `src/fontawesome.js` and paste in this code:

~~~
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import { faThumbsUp} from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

library.add(
    faThumbsUp
    ); 
~~~

### UI Design.

The desired UI for this app looks as follows:

![][hackerUI]

Note, each news item has a 'Comment' link. It will allow the user add a comment for the item.

The app's component breakdown is illustrated below:

![][hackerDesign]

This gives a component hierarchy as follows:

              App (default)
               |
         ---------------
        |              |
     NewsList      NewsForm
        | 
    NewsItem

Create the following file structure to support this component set:

![][hackfiles]

Commit the work to the Git repository (from the `twoApps/hackernews` folder) with the commands:

~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup completed"
~~~

Start the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npx start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook/
~~~
