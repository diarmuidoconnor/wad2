## Assembling the Home page.
 
We can now bring the components together to form a page in the app. Create the file `src/pages/homePage.js` and paste in this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/headerMovieList";
import MovieList from "../components/movieList";
import FilterControls from "../components/filterControls";

const MovieListPage = ({movies}) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header numMovies={movies.length} />
      <FilterControls />
      <MovieList movies={movies} />
    </>
  );
};

export default MovieListPage;
~~~
Javascript's new Object destructuring syntax is used on the props argument of the component function. This is a short-hand for the following:
~~~
const MovieListPage = (props) => {
  const movies = props.movies
   . . . . . . 
}
~~~

Ultimately this page will be plugged into a routing component but in the meantime we will statically link it to a top-level component that feeds it an array of movies. Create `src/index.js` and code it as follows:
~~~
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";

const movies = [sample, sample, sample, sample, sample];

const App = () => {

  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
~~~
The App component is at the top of the component hierarchy - this will change in a future lab. To see the HomePage rendering, stop the StoryBook server and start the development server provided by the create-react-app tool:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
The page should render as follows:

![][homepage]

The server provides live reloading. To illustrate, in `src/index.js` change the movies const to:
~~~
const movies = [sample, sample, sample];
~~~
On saving the file, notice the browser rendering  automatically updates.

Before continuing, from the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository, as follows:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Home Page rendering"
~~~

[homepage]: ./img/homepage.png
