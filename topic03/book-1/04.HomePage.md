## Assembling the Home page.
 
We can now bring the components together to form a page in the app. Create the file `src/pages/homePage.js` and paste in this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/headerMovieList";
import Grid from "@material-ui/core/Grid";
import { makeStyles } from "@material-ui/core/styles";
import MovieList from "../components/movieList";

const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: {
    padding: "20px",
  },
});

const MovieListPage = (props) => {
  const classes = useStyles();
  const movies = props.movies;
  
  return (
    <Grid container className={classes.root}>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <Header title={"Home Page"} />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item container spacing={5}>
        <MovieList movies={movies}></MovieList>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
};
export default MovieListPage;

~~~
Also, create the file `src/components/movieList/index.js` (referenced by the above code) and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import Movie from "../movieCard/";
import Grid from "@material-ui/core/Grid";

const MovieList = (props) => {
  let movieCards = props.movies.map((m) => (
    <Grid key={m.id} item xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3} xl={2}>
      <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} />
    </Grid>
  ));
  return movieCards;
};

export default MovieList;
~~~
We use the Material's Grid system above to enable a responsive UI. For example, when the browser's viewport is extra-large (xl), we allow six cards per row, whereas a small viewport (sm) allows only two cards per row - see later.

We will eventually plug this page into a routing component. In the meantime, we will statically link it to a top-level component that feeds it an array of movies. Create `src/index.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";

const movies = [sample, sample, sample, sample, sample, sample, sample];

const App = () => {
  return (
      <HomePage movies={movies} />
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
~~~
The App component is at the top of the component hierarchy - this will change in a future lab. To see the HomePage rendering, stop the StoryBook server and start the development server provided by the create-react-app tool:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
The page should render as follows:

![][homepage]

A small/mobile browser viewport renders the page as:

![][homepagesm]

Before continuing, from the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository as follows:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Home Page rendering."
~~~

[homepage]: ./img/homepage.png
[homepagesm]: ./img/homepagesm.png
