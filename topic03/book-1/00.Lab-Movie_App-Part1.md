# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we commence the development of a SPA for Movie enthusiasts. The development will span a number of weeks, with new functionality being added and existing code refactoring during that period. The data for the app will be retrieved from an open web API, [The Movie DataBase][tmdb].

>>## Please ensure you maintain a Git repository throughout the development of this app. You should submit all the 'git commit' commands specified in this and subsequent labs. A log of the repository commit history will be used in the assessment of your lab work for this module
