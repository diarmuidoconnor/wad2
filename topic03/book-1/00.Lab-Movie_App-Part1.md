# Developing a Movies Fan App.

In this lab, we commence the development of a SPA for Movie enthusiasts. The product will go through several iterations over the coming weeks, adding new functionality and refactoring existing code during that period. An open web API, [The Movie DataBase][tmdb], will be the data source for the app.
