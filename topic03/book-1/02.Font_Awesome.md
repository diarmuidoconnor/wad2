## Font Awesome.

Icons in various parts of the app's UI for visual effect. The [Font Awesome library][font] will be the source for these icons. 

In VS Code, create the file `src/globals/fontawesome.js and paste in this code:
~~~
import { library } from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core";
import {
  faStar,
  faFilm,
  faVideo,
  faHome,
  faCalendar,
  faArrowCircleLeft
} from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

library.add( faStar, faFilm, faVideo, faHome, faCalendar, faArrowCircleLeft);

~~~
We are creating a library object and populating it with the icons required - more can be added later if necessary. A React component that displays an icon will simply import the above file and access the required icon using a special third-party component - see later.

Before continuing, in the VS Code integrated terminal, update the git repository, as follows:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup Font Awesome library"
~~~
