## Start-up.

Download [this archive][start], unzip it and import it into VS Code. Open an integrate terminal and run:

```
$ npm install
```

This is a skeleton create-react-app project. The `src` folder has been divided into a number of subfolders to reflect the different code elements that make up a React app, based on best practice.

Our Movies Fan app will communicate with The TMDB API (Note: We are using version 3 of the API). All requests to the API are authenticated by an API KEY. You should now acquire a personal key for your development by following these steps:

- Signup for an account [here][signup].
- Log in to your account and click the "API" link in the left hand side bar of your account page.

In VS Code, in the project base folder create a new file called `.env` with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=.... your API key value ...
```

Later we will use this environment variable in HTTP calls to the API.

It is extremely important to keep you API key private. For example, never include it in a project pushed up to GitHub. Notice, in `.gitignore` we included `.env` to safeguard against this.

## The App Development process.

_Thinking in React_ is a development process recommended by the React design team (discussed in the lectures). This lab is focused on the first step of this process, titled `Build a static version` of the app. In subsequent labs we will add user interaction and routing.
