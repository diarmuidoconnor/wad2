## The App overview.

The features of the React app will include:

- Display a list of current movie releases. For each one, show its poster image, title, release date and viewer rating.
- Display more detailed information on a movie from the above list by clicking its 'More Info ..' button. The details include plot, genres, runtime, revenue, etc.
- Show extracts from written reviews for a movie.
- Show the full review text for a review.
- Add movies to your favourites list.
- Write a review for one of your favourites.

## Start-up.

Download [this archive][start], unzip it and import it into VS Code. Open an integrate terminal and run:

```
$ npm install
```

The archive contained a skeleton create-react-app project. The `src` folder has been divided into several subfolders to reflect the different code elements of a React app based on best practices.

Our Movies Fan app will communicate with The TMDB API (Note: We will use version 3 of the API). An API Key authenticates all requests to the API. Please follow these steps to acquire a personal key for development:

- Signup for an account [here][signup].
- Log in to your account. To get a key, follow this sequence:
 
>>>Settings > API > Create > Click on Request an API > Click "Developer" > Fill in Details

![][apikey]

In VS Code, in the project base folder, create a new file called `.env` with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=.... your API key value ...
FAST_REFRESH=false
```

Later we will use this environment variable in HTTP calls to the API.

It is imperative to keep your API key private. For example, never include it in a project pushed up to GitHub. Notice, in `.gitignore`, it is listed in `.env` to safeguard against this.

## The App Development process.

_Thinking in React_ is a development process recommended by the React design team (discussed in the lectures). This lab is focused on the first step of this process, titled `Build a static version` of the app. In subsequent labs, we will add user interaction and routing.
