## Exercise 5.

Create a new file in `functionslab`, called `exercise5.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list (200) of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to implement the same requirement as Exercise 3 BUT replace the map-filter combination with the reduce HOF.

Hint: The initial value for the reducer's accumulator will be an empty array ( [] ).

After completing a solution, update the git repository:
 ~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 5"
~~~
