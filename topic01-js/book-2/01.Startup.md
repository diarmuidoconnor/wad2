## Start-up.

We need to ensure that Git is configured properly before continuing. In particular, the username must be set to your full name. Open a terminal window (Shell/DOS window) and type the following to set the user name:

    $ git config --global user.name " .... your name ..."

e.g. git config --global user.name "Diarmuid O Connor"

[Note: By convention we use the dollar symbol ($) to represent the terminal prompt.]

Now check this worked:

    $ git config --global user.name

Unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. In `lab002/functions.js` we have a Javascript object whose properties relate to data attributes of a car. We will expand this file in the next few sections.

Create a Git repository in `lab02`:

       $ git init
       $ git add -A
       $ git commit -m "Initial structure"
