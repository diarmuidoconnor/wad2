## Start-up.

Download and unzip the sample code ([here][source]) supporting the lecture slides. Import the samples into VS Code and open the `index.html` file. Start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar. In the newly opened browser tab, open the Developer tools and select the Console tab. It should be displaying some users retrieved from the Random User API.

![][users]

You should reference the other scripts in this folder while working through the exercises in this lab.

Download and unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. Open a second window in VS Code and import the `functionslab` folder. In `index.html` we reference the script `webAPICall.js` which communicates with a fake web API called [JSONPlaceholder][fake]. It accepts requests for a variety of resources, including, posts, albums, users, todos. Our script code is requesting a list of todos - 200 are returned. Start the Live server and examine the API response in the browser:

![][todos]

The API returns an array of todos. Each todo has an id, title, userID and completed status.

In VS Code, open an integrated terminal window and create a Git repository in the `functionslab` folder:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure"
~~~
