## Start-up.

Unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. In `lab002/functions.js` we have a Javascript object whose properties relate to data attributes of a car. We will expand this file in the next few sections.

Create a Git repository in `lab02`:

       $ git init
       $ git add -A
       $ git commit -m "Initial structure"
