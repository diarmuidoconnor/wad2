## Start-up.
### Lecture code samples.

Download and unzip the sample code ([here][source]) supporting the lecture slides. Import the samples into VS Code and open the `index.html` file. Start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar. In the newly opened browser tab, open the Developer tools and select the Console tab. It should be displaying some users retrieved from the Random User API.

![][users]

It would help if you referenced the other scripts in this folder while working through the exercises in this lab.

### Lab exercise code.

Download and unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. Open a second window in VS Code and import the `functionslab` folder. In `index.html`, we reference the script `webAPICall.js`, which communicates with a fake web API called [JSONPlaceholder][fake]. It accepts requests for a variety of resources, e.g. posts, albums, users, todos. Our script code is requesting a list of todos - it returns 200. Start the Live server and examine the API response in the browser:

![][todos]

The API returns an array of todos. Each todo has an id, title, userID and completed status.

In VS Code, open an integrated terminal window and create a Git repository in the `functionslab` folder:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure."
~~~

We need to create a backup copy of this repository on GitHub. Create a new repository called `js-functions-lab` in your GitHub account. Synchronise this remote repository with your local one by typing the command below in VS Code - user your GitHub username instead of `diarmuidoconnor` in the URL: 

~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/js-functions-lab.git
$ git push origin master
~~~
In the browser, refresh the GitHub page and notice your JS code is now stored in the remote repo.
