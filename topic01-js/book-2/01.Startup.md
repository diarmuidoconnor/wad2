## Startup.

While _Storybook_ is a tool for developing individual components, the _create-react-app_ tool is for application (app) development. For convenience, we will use the 'course modules' context again but add some small improvements.

In the terminal window, create a new folder (away from `basicReactLab`). Go to this new folder and type the commands:
~~~
$ npx create-react-app course-app
$ cd course-app
~~~
The first command **scaffolded** a React project, located in a new folder called `course-app` (see illustration).

![][scaffold]

It's actually a runnable app already. To prove it, type the command:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
This command performs the following task sequence:

- Transpiles any JSX and ES6 code in the `src` folder. It starts with `src/index.js` and then follows the import statements to find other source file dependencies. Note, you will not see physical evidence of the transpiled files on the filesystem. This will only occur at the production stage (covered later).
- Starts a **development-mode web server** on port 3000.
- Opens a tab in your default web browser and issue a HTTP request to http://localhost:3000/
- The server responds with `public/index.html`, followed by relevant assets (transpiled JS, CSS etc).

The server performs **live reloading**: watches all project source files for updates and re-transpiles and reloads the app in the browser when changes occur.

The browser should now be displaying the default React app:

![][default]

We will mold this skeleton app into our simple custom app. The desired user interface we want is as follows:

![][obj]

The app's component hierarchy design will be as follows:
~~~
       App (default)
        |
        |
        V
      Course
        |
        |  (multiple)
        V
      Module
~~~
The App component renders a child called Course. Course renders many instances of a Module component. To achieve this, first create a sub-folder of `src` called `components`.
