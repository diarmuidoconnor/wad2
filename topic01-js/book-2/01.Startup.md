## Start-up.

Unzip [this archive][start] and use it as the starting point for the lab exercises. 
The content of `lab002/functions.js` should look familiar - it's from the previous lab exercise. We will expand this file in the next few sections.

Create a Git repository in `lab02`:

       $ git init
       $ git add -A
       $ git commit -m "Initial structure"
