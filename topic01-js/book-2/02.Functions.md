## Functions.

Suppose we want a function that allows us add an entry to the *previous_owners* property of *aCar*. Copy the following function expression, placing it at the end of `functions.js`:

	let addPreviousOwner = function(car, newName, newAddress) {
			let o = { name : newName, address : newAddress } ;
			car.previous_owners.push(o) ;
		} ;

To test the above function, place the following statements after the function expression:

		addPreviousOwner(aCar,'Jim Nugent','3 Lower Road') ;
		let last = aCar.previous_owners.length - 1;
		console.log(aCar.previous_owners[last].name) ;

Run it, as follows:

         $ node functions.js

The log statement displays 'Jim Nugent'.

Assume we only need to record the three most recent previous owners of a car. Trying to add a fourth person should cause the first previous owner to be removed from the record, leaving the second owner as the new first entry in the array. A similar outcome should happen on adding a fifth and subsequent person - the array should only ever have a maximum of three entries. __You are required__ to change the implementation of the *addPreviousOwner* function to meet this requirement. 

Hint: The *shift* method removes the first entry in an array, e.g. arrayRef.shift().

To test your solution, add the following additional lines to the bottom of `functions.js`:

		 addPreviousOwner(aCar,'Rachel Fleming','4 Upper Road') 
		 console.log(aCar.previous_owners[2].name) 
		 console.log(aCar.previous_owners[0].name) 

The two log statements should display the names 'Rachel Fleming' and 'Sheila Dwyer'.
