## Exercise 6.

Create a new file in `functionslab`, called `exercise6.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list (200) of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that computes the number of completed todos per user. A user with no completed todos should not appear in the output. Use the Array.reduce HOF in your solution.

The output should look similar to the following:

![][completedperuser]

It shows, for example, user 1 has 11 completed todos, user 2 has 8, etc. The object structure that contains the result has keys corresponding to user IDs from the source data.

After completing the solution, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 6."
~~~

[completedperuser]: ./img/completedperuser.png
