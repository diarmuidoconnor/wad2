## Exercise 4.

Create a new file in `functionslab`, called `exercise4.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list (200) of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that computes (and displays) the number of completed todos. Use the Array.reduce HOF in your solution.

After completing a solution, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 4."
$ git push origin master
~~~
