## DOM API exercise.

This exercise aims to gain a basic understanding of the role of the DOM in a browser. By programmatically changing the DOM, we can achieve a dynamic web page. 

Download [this archive][start], unzip it and copy the HTML file into the `functionsLab' folder. Start the Live server (Go Live). In the newly opened browser tab, manually type the new page's name: 

![][dynamicPage]

Study the script code in the new HTML file. When the web page loads in the browser, the script makes an HTTP call to the Random User web API. We achieve this by assigning an event handler to the browser's 'window load' event. On receiving a response, it appends a 'li' element to the 'ul' DOM node for each user profile returned by the API. This code is an example of dynamically updating the DOM. The result is the list of profile names appear on the web page.

__Your task__ is to filter the list of names in response to the user typing in the text box

![][dynamicPage2]

When the user types in the text box and hits return, an even handler executes - the filterUsers function. Currently, the function shows how to access the value typed in the box. You must complete its implementation. 

For your convenience, the cleanListElements function has been included. It demonstrates how to remove all li elements from the ul list. You do not need to change this function, but you may need to call it elsewhere in your script code.
