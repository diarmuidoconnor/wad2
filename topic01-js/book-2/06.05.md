## Building the app.

The app is now complete but clearly the development server environment is not suitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not be happening dynamically and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
$ npm run build
~~~
This creates a `build` folder to house the production-quality, static form of the app:

![][build]

All the app's JS code is stored in ONE JS file and the content is **minified**. The file name is a computed hash value to aid browser caching operations.

To use the production version of the app we need a standard web server. If you already have one installed, start it from the `course-app/build` folder and view the app in the browser. Otherwise, install this simple HTTP server:
~~~
$ npm install -g httpserver
~~~
and start it from the `course-app/build` folder, as follows:
~~~
$ httpserver -p 8080
~~~
In the browser navigate to: http://localhost:8080.

Notice in the `.gitignore` file (generted by CRA) the `/build` folder is included - we  never commit generatyed files to a repository.
