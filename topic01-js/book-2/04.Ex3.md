## Exercise 3.

The Array HOFs can be combined, for example, map over the array produced from the filter function:

> const finalResult = sourceArray.filter(......).map(.......)

The input array for map is the output array produced by filter.

Create a new file in `functionslab`, called `exercise3.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that creates an array of uncompleted todo objects, where an object just contains a userID and todo title. It then displays the array:
~~~
    console.log(uncompleted)
~~~
The output should look as follows:

![][incompleted]

To confirm your solution, in `index.html` change the script tag to refer to `./exercise3.js`.

On completion, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3"
~~~
[incompleted]: ./img/incompleted.png
