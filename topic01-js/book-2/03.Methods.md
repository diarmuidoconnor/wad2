## Methods.

The *addPreviousOwner* function should really be a method of *aCar*. Make the following adjustment to the *aCar* object:

		let aCar = {
			.
			.
			.
			addPreviousOwner : function(newName,newAddress) {
			       let o = { name : newName, address : newAddress } ;
			       if (this.previous_owners.length === 3) {
			       	  this.previous_owners.shift() ;
			       }
			       this.previous_owners.push(o) ;
			    },
		       previous_owners : [  . . . as before . . . ],
			. . . as before . . .
		}; // end aCar 

Note, the keyword 'this' is used inside the method to reference the containing object (aCar). You should now remove the old *addPreviousOwner* function expression and replace all calls to it with method calls, as follows (the 'console.log' statements remain unchanged):

        aCar.addPreviousOwner('Jim Nugent','3 Lower Road') ;

__You are required__ to add a new method to *aCar*, called *newOwner*. The method's arguments are the name and address of the new owner of the car. The method should add the current owner details to the list of previous owners and then assign the new owner details  to the current owner properties. 
 
        let aCar = {
	        owner : 'Joe Bloggs',        // Current owner details
	        address : '3 Walkers Lane',
	        .
	        .
	        .
	    } ;

Test your method implementation by adding the following statements to the end of the file:  

		aCar.newOwner('Donal Dunne','5 Kings Way') ;
		console.log('Sold by: ' + aCar.previous_owners[2].name) ;
		console.log('Bought by: ' + aCar.owner) ;

The log statements should display:

>>Sold by: Joe Bloggs
>>Bought by: Donal Dunne

### Method/Function return value.

Our methods so far returned nothing (undefined). It is generally better to return something explicitly, even if the caller may not actually use it.

Add the following method to  aCar:

		let aCar = {
			. . . . . 
			howOld : function() {
			    let today = new Date();
				let thisYear = today.getFullYear() ;
		        return thisYear - (this.registration.year + 2000) ;
			},
			.
			.
			.
		}


[The Date feature used in the above method is useful. You can experiment with it in the Google Chrome Developer tools, as illustrated below:

![][date]

]

The howOld function computes the car's age, in years. To test it, add the following log statement at the end of the file and run it:

     console.log(`Car age: ${ aCar.howOld() } years.`) ;

[The above log statement is using string template syntax from ES^. It's an alternative to string concatenation, which is quite cumbersome.]

Some methods return a boolean result. For example, add a method that determines whether a car has a certain feature, as follows:


		let aCar = {
		    . . . . .
			addPreviousOwner : function(.....) { 
		        . . . . .
		    },
			hasFeature : function(query) {
				let result = false;
			    this.features.forEach(function(feature) {
			   	    if (query.toUpperCase() === feature.toUpperCase() ) {
					   result = true ;
				    }
				})
			    return result ;
			},
			.
			.
			. 
		}

[For robustness the method above is made case-insensitive by temporarily converting any string to upper-case.]

To test this method add the following to the bottom of the file and run the code:

     console.log(`Alarm: ${aCar.hasFeature('alarm')}.` ) ;

__You are required__ to implement a method that determines if a particular person (based on name only) was a previous owner of the car. Test your implementation by adding the following to the end of the file:

     let name = 'Jim Nugent'
     console.log(`${name} ? ${aCar.wasOwnedBy(name)}.` ) 
     name = 'Paul Minihan' 
     console.log(`${name} ? ${aCar.wasOwnedBy(name)}.` ) ;

The log statements should display:

		Jim Nugent ? true
		Paul Minihan ? false

[See [Solution 03][solution] for the correct implementation.]

        $ git commit -m "Method responses"

Because searching an array for a matching entry is such a common requirement, the Array *find* method is provided. Change the implementation of *hasFeature* to the following:

        .
        .
        .
		hasFeature : function(query) {
			let match = this.features.find(function(element) {
				return query.toUpperCase() === element.toUpperCase() ;
			});
			return match === undefined ? false : true 
		},
		.
		.
		.

*find* returns the matching array entry, if found; otherwise it returns undefined. The ternary operator (?:) is also used above for convenience. See [here][find] for more information on *find*. 

__You are required__ to refactor the *wasOwnedBy* method to avail of the Array find feature.
