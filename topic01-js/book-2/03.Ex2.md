## Exercise 2.

Create a new file in `functionslab`, called `exercise2.js`. Use the same fetch statement as Exercise 1 to request a list (200) of todos.

In the body of the fetch, you are required to write the code that creates a new array (todoTitles) containing just the titles of all the todos and then displays the array.
~~~
  console.log(todoTitles)
~~~
 Use the Array.Map HOF in your solution. The output should look as follows:

![][titles]

To confirm your solution, in `index.html` change the script tag to refer to `./exercise2.js`.

After completing a solution, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 2"
~~~
