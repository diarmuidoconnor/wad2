## Constructors.

The literal object syntax used in the previous sections is inefficient when creating multiple car objects. A __constructor function__ should be used instead. 

Create a new file in `lab002`. called `constructor.js`. and paste in this code:
 
		function Car(name,address,make,model,cc,registration ) {
			this.owner = name
			this.address = address
			this.previous_owners = [ ]
			this.type = { make : make, model : model, cc : cc }
			this.features = ['Parking assist', 'Alarm', 'Tow-bar'];

			this.addPreviousOwner = function(newName,newAddress) {
				let o = { name : newName, address : newAddress }
				if (this.previous_owners.length === 3) {
					this.previous_owners.shift()
				}
				this.previous_owners.push(o)
			};
			
			this.wasOwnedBy = function(query) {
				let match = this.previous_owners.find(function(element) {
					return element.name.toUpperCase() === query.toUpperCase() ;
				});
				return match == undefined ? false : true 
			};
		}

		let car1 = new Car('Joe Bloggs','3 Walkers Lane',
			'Toyota','Corolla',1.8,
			'101-WD-1058') ;
		car1.addPreviousOwner( 'Pat Smith', '1 Main Street') ;
		car1.addPreviousOwner( 'Pat Smith', '1 Main Street') ;
		car1.addPreviousOwner( 'Sheila Dwyer', 
			'2 High Street') ;
		console.log(`Pat Smith ?  ${car1.wasOwnedBy('Pat Smith')}.` ) ;


Note, this code is not yet complete. Take time to study it and then run it:

        $ node constructor.js 
 
 Update the git repository:
 
        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Added initial car constructor"
 
In the previous section we declared a *newOwner* method. Using that implementation as a guide, __you are required__ to add the method to the *Car* constructor. Test it by adding the following to the end of `constructor.js`:

	   car1.newOwner('Donal Dunne','5 Kings Way') ;
       console.log('Sold by: ' + car1.previous_owners[2].name) 
       console.log('Bought by: ' + car1.owner) 

The log statements should display the seller as 'Joe Bloggs' and buyer as 'Donal Dunne'.

(See Solution 04 [here][solution] for the completed code.)

Update the git repository:
 
        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "newOwner added to constructor"

The car registration details are not yet supported. While this information is stored internally as an object structure, we don't need to expose this in the constructor's interface. Using a simple string as the constructor parameter seems more natural, e.g. new Car(....,'101-WD-1058'). Consequently, the constructor function must parse the registration string and place the elements in the nested object. The predefined String *split* method can help here. You can experiment with it in  Chrome's Developer Tools console, as illustrated below: 

![][split]

Update the Car constructor to make use of this feature, as follows:

		function Car(name, address, make, model, cc, registration) {
            .
            .
            .
			let regParts = registration.split('-')
		    let year = parseInt(regParts[0].substring(0,2));
		    let part = regParts[0].substring(2);
			this.registration = {
				year : year,
				part: part, 
				county : regParts[1], 
				number : regParts[2] 
			};
		}

[ The *parseInt()* function converts a numeric string to an integer.]

To prove the new code works, add the *howOld* method, as follows:

		function Car(... as before ...) {
		    .
		    . 
		    .
			this.howOld = function() {
				let today = new Date();
				let thisYear = today.getFullYear();
		        return thisYear - (this.registration.year + 2000);
			};

			this.newOwner = function(....) { . . . .  } ;
			. . . . . 
		}
	  
and add this test line to the end of the file:

      console.log(`Car age: ${car1.howOld()}` ) ;

The log statement should display 'Car age: 9'. 

Update the git repository:
 
        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Add registration support and howOld method"
