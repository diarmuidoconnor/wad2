## Start-up.

We need to ensure that Git is configured properly before continuing. In particular, the username must be set to your full name. Open a terminal window (Shell/DOS window) and type the following to set the user name:
~~~
$ git config --global user.name " .... your name ..."
~~~
e.g. git config --global user.name "Diarmuid O Connor"

[Note: By convention we use the dollar symbol ($) to represent the terminal prompt.]

Now check this worked:
~~~
$ git config --global user.name
~~~

In your VS Code editor, click the *Extensions* icon on the Activity bar (left-hand side menu) and search for the `Live Server` extension. Click its Install button.

Download the sample code ([here][source]) supporting the lecture slides and unzip the archive. Import the samples into VS Code and open the `index.html` file. Start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar (bottom menu):

![][live]

This should open a new tab in your browser. Open the Developer Tools in the browser (see screenshot):

![][devtool]

In VS Code, in `index.html` uncomment the `01_primitives.js` script. The Live Server will 
now reload the page in the browser

![][primitives]

In `index.html` comment out the `01_primitives.js` script and uncomment the '02_objects.js` script. The browser should now look as follows:

![][objects]

The Live Server is now working successfully. Stop the server by clicking the `Port 5501` link in VS Code's Status Bar.

Create a new folder (away from `dataSamples`), called `lab001`, and in it create two files:

+ `index.html`:
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lab 001</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>JS Data</h1>
    <script src="./fundamentals.js "></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
+ and `fundamentals.js`
~~~
const aCar = {
	owner : "Joe Bloggs",
	type : 'Toyota Corolla 1.8',
	registration : '201WD1058'
};

console.log(aCar.owner);
~~~

Assuming this folder is currently open in VS Code, start the Live Server again. In the newly opened browser tab open the Developer Tools. Its Console should be displaying 'Joe Bloggs'.

In VS Code, open an integrated terminal window - Use the View > Terminal menu command. Add a git repository to the `lab001` folder by typing the following commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure"
~~~
