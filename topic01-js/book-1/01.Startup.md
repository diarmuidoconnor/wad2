## Start-up.
### Install VS Code extension.

In the VS Code editor, click the *Extensions* icon on the Activity bar (left-hand side menu) and search for the `Live Server` extension. Click its Install button.

### The Lecture code samples.

Download and unzip the sample code ([here][source]) accompanying the lecture slides. Import the samples into VS Code and open the `index.html` file. Start the Live Server by clicking the 'Go Live' link on the Status bar:

![][live]

A new browser tab is now open. Open the Developer Tools in the tab:

![][devtool]

In the `index.html` file, uncomment the `01_primitives.js` script and save it. The Live Server reloads the page in the browser:

![][primitives]

In `index.html`, comment out the `01_primitives.js` script and uncomment the '02_objects.js` script. The live server reloads the page again: 

![][objects]

Leave the server running, but you can stop it at any time by clicking the `Port 55xx` link in VS Code's Status Bar:

![][stop]
### This lab's starter code.

Create a new folder (away from `dataSamples`), called `lab001`, and in it, create two files:

+ `index.html`:
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lab 001</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>JS Data</h1>
    <script src="./fundamentals.js "></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
+ and `fundamentals.js`:
~~~
const aCar = {
  owner : "Joe Bloggs",
  type : 'Toyota Corolla 1.8',
  registration : '201WD1058'
};

console.log(aCar.owner);
~~~

In VS code, open a second window:

![][window]

Import the `lab001` folder into this window. Start the Live Server from this workspace - we can have multiple instances of the server running where each uses a different port number. In the newly opened browser tab, open the Developer Tools. Its Console tab should be displaying 'Joe Bloggs'.

In this VS Code window, open an integrated terminal and type the commands:
~~~
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure."
~~~
These commands added a git repository to `lab001` folder on your computer:

![][gitinit]

We need to create a backup copy of this repository on GitHub. Create a new repository called `js-objects-lab` in your GitHub account.

![][newrepo]

Synchronise this remote repository with your local one by typing the command below in VS Code - user your GitHub username instead of `diarmuidoconnor` in the URL: 
~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/js-objects-lab.git
~~~
And now synchronise the two repos:
~~~
$ git push origin master
~~~
In the browser, refresh the GitHub page and notice your JS code is now stored in the remote repo.

----------------------
Returning to the lab exercise, you have two Live Server instances running, and each has an associated browser tab. Anytime you change a source code file, Live Server will reload its web page in the relevant browser tab, thus allowing you to check the execution of those changes.
