## Start-up.

We need to ensure that Git is configured properly before continuing. In particular, the username must be set to your full name. Open a terminal window (Shell/DOS window) and type the following to set the user name:

    $ git config --global user.name " .... your name ..."

e.g. git config --global user.name "Diarmuid O Connor"

[Note: By convention we use the dollar symbol ($) to represent the terminal prompt.]

Now check this worked:

    $ git config --global user.name

Download the sample code ([here][source]) supporting the lecture slides and unzip the archive. Open a terminal window (Shell/DOS window) and use the *cd* command to relocate to this code's base folder (the `samplecode` folder). Run the first sample script, as follows:

	$ node 01_primitives.js

[Again, the dollar symbol ($) is used to represent the terminal prompt - it is not part of a typed command.]

The screen-shot shows the expected result.

Now examine the code in the script file `02_objects.js` and run it:

	$ node 02_objects.js

Do you understand how the code generated the response displayed?

Create a new folder (away from `samplecode`), called `lab001`, and in it create a file named `fundamentals.js`. Paste the code below into this file:

		let aCar = {
			owner : "Joe Bloggs",
			type : 'Toyota Corolla 1.8',
			registration : '10WD1058'
		};

		console.log(aCar.owner);

Open a second terminal window, go to the `lab001` folder and run the script:

	$ node fundamentals.js 

It should display the car owner's name.

Add a git repository to the `lab001` folder:

        $ git init
        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Initial structure"
