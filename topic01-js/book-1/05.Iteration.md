## Looping/Iteration constructs.

Suppose the car has a list of *extra features*. We can represent this as a simple array of strings, as follows:
~~~
const aCar = {
    owner : 'Joe Bloggs',
    .
    .
    .
    features : ['Parking assist', 'Alarm', 'Tow-bar'],
    registration : .......
} ;
~~~
At the end of `fundamentals.js`, add a for-loop to display this list, as follows:
~~~
for (let i = 0 ; i < aCar.features.length ; i += 1) {
    console.log(aCar.features[i]) ;
} 
~~~

__You are required__ to write a second for-loop that displays the name of each previous owner. 

(If required, see Solution 05 on the Solutions page.)

The loop construct for iterating over an object's properties is slightly different. For example, to display the key-value pairs in the *type* property of aCar, add the following code at the end of `fundamentals.js`:
~~~
for (let p in aCar.type)  {
    console.log(p.toUpperCase() + ' = ' + aCar.type[p] ) ;
}
~~~

In the above code, the expression `aCar.type[p]` demonstrates the __subscript notation__ style for accessing an object's properties. The p variable is de-referenced before evaluating the expression.
~~~
e.g.
let mk = 'make' 
aCar.type[mk] becomes aCar.type['make']
~~~
We used the __dot notation__ style in all the earlier examples, e.g. aCar.type.make). However, it will not work in the above case as de-referencing does not take place - 'aCar.type.mk' evaluates to undefined.
