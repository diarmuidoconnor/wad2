# The Browser as a Javascript Development tool.

In recent years, browser vendors have added excellent *Developer Tools* to assist with debugging web applications. In this module we use the developer tools in the [Google Chrome][chrome] browser only - other browsers have similar tools. 

As we have seen in the previous sections, the DevTools Console tab displays any log statements from the current web page's associated Javascript code. The Console also allows us interact with the JS code by typing statements at the prompt. At the prompt, type aCar and hit return:
          
![][prompt]

When a statement execution returns an object (as above) rather than a primitive then you can expand the object to see its property detail. We can also change any object property, for example, type these two statements at the prompt:
~~~
> aCar.color.exterior = 'blue'
> aCar.color
~~~
The Console attempts to evaluate any JavaScript expression you enter at the prompt. It also provides __auto-completion and tab-completion__. For example, as you type expressions, property names are automatically suggested (see illustration). If there are multiple properties with the same prefix, pressing the Tab key cycles through them. Pressing the right arrow key accepts the current suggestion. 

![][completion]

Notice that the *aCar* object has a number of properties not explicitly defined by us - see illustration. These are inherited by all objects by default - some are useful. 

![][properties]

Experiment a while with the tool; it will be useful for debugging application code later in the semester.
