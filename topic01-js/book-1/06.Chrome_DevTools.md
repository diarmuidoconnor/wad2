# The Browser as a Javascript Development tool.

So far we have used the __node.js__ platform to execute JS code. However, the Web Browser was the original JS execution environment. In recent years, browser vendors have added excellent *Developer Tools* to assist with debugging web applications. The remainder of this lab introduces the developer tools in the [Google Chrome][chrome] browser - other browsers have similar tools. [You should install this browser to complete the lab.] 

To demonstrate the tools, we will paste the JS code developed so far into a blank web page. Download [this file][demo], unzip it and study the content. Open the `demo.html` web page in the Chrome browser. Although the page renders as blank, the JS code inside the 'script' tag has been executed. To prove this, open the Developer tools by clicking the Chrome menu icon on the top right and selecting the tools, as illustrated below:

![][devtool]

The tools pane appears in the browser window and the __Console__ tab is selected as the default (if not then select it manually). All the log statements from our JS code appear in the console view, as illustrated below:

![][console]

The Console allows us interact with the JS code by typing statements at the prompt. [In a later lab we will use the console to interact with the current web page]. At the prompt, type the following statement and hit return:

          aCar.owner

The response is illustrated below:

![][prompt]

We can also change any object property, for example, type these two statements at the prompt:

        aCar.color.exterior = 'blue'
        aCar.color.exterior

The Console attempts to evaluate any JavaScript expression you enter at the prompt. It also provides __auto-completion and tab-completion__. For example, as you type expressions, property names are automatically suggested (see illustration). If there are multiple properties with the same prefix, pressing the Tab key cycles through them. Pressing the right arrow key accepts the current suggestion. 

![][completion]

Notice that the *aCar* object has a number of properties not explicitly defined by us - see illustration. These are inherited by all objects by default - some are useful. 

![][properties]

When a statement execution returns an object rather than a primitive then you can expand the object to see its property detail.

![][expand]

Experiment a while with the tool; it will be useful for debugging application code later in the semester.
