# The Browser Development tools.

In recent years, browser vendors have added excellent *Developer Tools* to debug web applications. We will use the developer tools in the [Google Chrome][chrome] browser only - other browsers have similar tools. 

As seen in the previous sections, the DevTools Console tab displays any log statements from the current web page's associated Javascript code. The Console also allows us to interact with the JS code by typing statements. At the console prompt, type aCar and hit return:
          
![][prompt]

When a statement execution returns an object (as above) rather than a primitive, you can expand the object to see its property detail. We can also change any object property; for example, type these two statements at the prompt:
~~~
> aCar.color.exterior = 'blue'
> aCar.color
~~~
The Console attempts to evaluate any JavaScript expression you enter at the prompt. It also provides __auto-completion and tab-completion__. For example, as you type expressions, property names are automatically suggested (see illustration). If there are multiple properties with the same prefix, pressing the Tab key cycles through them. Pressing the right arrow key accepts the current suggestion. 

![][completion]

Notice that the *aCar* object has several properties not explicitly defined by us - see illustration. All objects inherit these properties by default - some are useful. 

![][properties]

Experiment a while with the tool; it will help debug application code later in the semester.
