## Exercise 3 (Props).

The next design improvement to our component is to make it __reusable__ by passing any model data in as __props__. The component's props include:

+ An array of (exactly two) modules and
+ The course name. 

The story for this exercise is already implemented. In `stories/exercises.js` see:

        .add("03 - component with props", () => {
          const twoModules = [modules[0], modules[1]];
          return <CourseModulesWithProps modules={twoModules} course={name} />;
        })

Implement your solution in `components/exercises/03_props.js`. Use the *render()* method from the solution to exercise 2 as the starting point. Reference `components/samples/03_props.js` as a guide to the changes required. Make sure to use the prop names used in the story above:

+ course
+ modules

In the browser, click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' to see your solution render.
On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands:

        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed"

Restart the server.
