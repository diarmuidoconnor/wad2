## Arrays.

Examine `dataSamples/05_arrays.js` from the samples and use it as an aid in the exercise below.

### Exercise.

In `lab001/fundamentals.js`, add a *previous owners* property to *aCar*, as follows:
~~~
const aCar = {
  owner: "Joe Bloggs",
  previous_owners: [
    "Pat Smith - 1 Main Street",
    "Sheila Dwyer - 2 High Street"
  ],
  . . . . as before . . . . 
};
~~~

To test the new property, add a log statement to the bottom of the file, as follows:
~~~
console.log('First owner : ' + aCar.previous_owners[0] )
~~~
The new log statement displays: __First owner : Pat Smith - 1 Main Street__.

A better design for *previous_owners* would be an array of objects, where each object's structure is:
~~~
{ name : ' .......', address : '.......'}
~~~
__You are required__ to change *previous_owners* property to reflect this redesign and also rewrite the log statement so that it still displays the same information.

(If required, the solution is on the Solutions page under 'Solution 04'.)

For completeness, add a property to *aCar* for the current owner's address, as follows:
~~~
const aCar = {
  owner : 'Joe Bloggs',
  address : '3 Walkers Lane',
  previous_owners : ...........
  ........
} ;
~~~

Before continuing, update the git repository:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Arrays."
~~~
