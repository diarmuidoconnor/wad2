## Arrays.

Examine `05_arrays.js` from the samples. Run it and ensure you understand how it generated its output.

In `fundamentals.js` add a *previous owners* property to *aCar* (statically for simplicity), as follows:

		let aCar = {
			owner : 'Joe Bloggs',
		    previous_owners : ['Pat Smith - 1 Main Street', 
		                       'Sheila Dwyer - 2 High Street'],
		    . . . . . . 
			registration : {year : 10, county : 'WD', number : 1058}
		} ;

This new property is an array of strings. To test it, add a log statement to the bottom of the file, as follows:

	  console.log('First owner : ' + aCar.previous_owners[0] )

and run the code:

		$ node fundamentals.js 

The new log statement displays: __First owner : Pat Smith - 1 Main Street__.

A better design for *previous_owners* would be an array of objects, where each object's structure is:

          { name : ' .......', address : '.......'}

__You are required__ to change *previous_owners*  to reflect this redesign and also rewrite the log statement so that it still displays the same information.

(The solution is in the Solutions tab under 'Solution 04'.)

For completeness, add a property to *aCar* for the current owner's address, as follows:

		let aCar = {
			owner : 'Joe Bloggs',
			address : '3 Walkers Lane',
			previous_owners : ...........
		    .
		    .
		    .
		} ;
