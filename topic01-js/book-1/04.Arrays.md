## Arrays.

Examine `dataSamples/05_arrays.js` from the samples.

In `fundamentals.js` add a *previous owners* property to *aCar* (statically for simplicity), as follows:
~~~
const aCar = {
  owner: "Joe Bloggs",
  previous_owners: [
    "Pat Smith - 1 Main Street",
    "Sheila Dwyer - 2 High Street"
  ],
  . . . . . . . . 
};
~~~

To test the new property, add a log statement to the bottom of the file, as follows:
~~~
console.log('First owner : ' + aCar.previous_owners[0] )
~~~
The new log statement displays: __First owner : Pat Smith - 1 Main Street__.

A better design for *previous_owners* would be an array of objects, where each object's structure is:
~~~
{ name : ' .......', address : '.......'}
~~~
__You are required__ to change *previous_owners*  to reflect this redesign and also rewrite the log statement so that it still displays the same information.

(The solution is in the Solutions tab under 'Solution 04'.)

For completeness, add a property to *aCar* for the current owner's address, as follows:
~~~
const aCar = {
	owner : 'Joe Bloggs',
	address : '3 Walkers Lane',
	previous_owners : ...........
	........
} ;
~~~
