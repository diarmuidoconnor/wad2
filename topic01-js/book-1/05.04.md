## Exercise 4 (Iteration).
 
In the previous exercise the component was hard-coded to expect a modules array prop of exactly two elements. It should be able to handle any __array size__. 

__You are required__ to implement your solution to this requirement in `components/exercises/04_iteration.js`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.js` as a guide.


The story for this exercise is already implemented. In `stories/exercises.js` see:

     .add("04 - iteration", () => {
        return <CourseModulesCollections modules={modules} course={name} />;
     });

THe Storybook page renders your solution on clicking 'Exercises -> 04 - iteration'. THe rendered output should be as follows:

![][exercise4] 

An outline solution is [available here][solutions].

On completing the exercise, update the local repository:

        $ git add -A
        $ git commit -m "Exercise 4 completed"

That completes this part of the lab.
