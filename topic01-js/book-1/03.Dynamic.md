## Dynamic properties.

Examine the file `dataSamples/03_dynamic_objects.js`. Notice how properties can be dynamically added (employer) and removed (age) __after initialising__ the *me* object. In `index.html`, enable this script file and confirm its execution in the browser tab's Developer tools. Use this code as a guide to the exercise below.

### Exercise.

In `lab001/fundamentals.js`, __after the initialisation statement__, dynamically add two new properties to *aCar*, namely:

1. mileage - set it to 10000.
1. colour - this should be an object rather than a primitive value. It should detail exterior colour (say, red) and interior fabric. Interior has two attributes, namely, texture (e.g. leather) and shade (e.g. cream).

To test your solution, add a 'console.log' statement at the end of the file that displays the following: __It is a red car, 10000 mileage, with leather interior.__.

(If required, the solution is on the Solutions page under 'Solution 03'.)

Before continuing, update the git repository (from the `lab001` folder):
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Dynamic properties."
