## Dynamic properties.

For this section examine `dataSamples/03_dynamic_objects.js` from the samples provided. Notice how properties can be dynamically added (employer) and removed (age) __after the initialization__ of the *me* object. 

In `fundamentals.js`, __after the initialization statement__, dynamically add two new properties to *aCar*, namely:

1. mileage - set it to 10000.
1. color - this should be an object rather than a primitive value. It should detail exterior color (say, red) and interior fabric. Interior has two attributes, namely, texture (e.g. leather) and shade (e.g. cream).

To test your solution, add a 'console.log' statement at the end of the file that displays the following: __It is a red car, 10000 mileage, with leather interior.__.

(The solution is in the Solutions tab under 'Solution 03'.)
