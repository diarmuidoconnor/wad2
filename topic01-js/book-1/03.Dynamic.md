## Dynamic properties.

Stop the Live Server, switch to the VS Code window for the `dataSamples` project, and restart the server.

Examine the file `dataSamples/03_dynamic_objects.js`. Notice how properties can be dynamically added (employer) and removed (age) __after the initialization__ of the *me* object. In `index.html`, enable this script file snd confirm its execution in the browser Developer tools. Use this code as a guide to the exercise below.

### Exercise.

Stop the Live Server, switch to the VS Code window for the `lab001` project, and restart the server. In `fundamentals.js`, __after the initialization statement__, dynamically add two new properties to *aCar*, namely:

1. mileage - set it to 10000.
1. color - this should be an object rather than a primitive value. It should detail exterior color (say, red) and interior fabric. Interior has two attributes, namely, texture (e.g. leather) and shade (e.g. cream).

To test your solution, add a 'console.log' statement at the end of the file that displays the following: __It is a red car, 10000 mileage, with leather interior.__.

(If required, the solution is in the Solutions page under 'Solution 03'.)

Before continuing, update the git repository (from `lab001` folder):
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Dynamic properties"
