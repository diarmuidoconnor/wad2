## Nested Objects.

Examine the file `dataSamples/04_1_nested_objects.js`. In its associated `index.html`, enable this script file and confirm its execution in the linked browser tab's Developer tools, as before. Use this code as a guide to the exercise below.

### Exercise.

In `lab001/fundamentals.js`, the car's *type* property is currently a simple string, but structurally we can break it down into three parts: Make (e.g. Toyota), Model (e.g. Corolla), and CC (e.g. 1.8). __You are required__ to change this property of *aCar* from a string to an object with three properties, namely *make*, *model* and *cc*. To prove your change worked, add the following log statement to the bottom of the file:
~~~
console.log(aCar.owner + ' drives a ' + aCar.type.make)
~~~

![][nested]

(If required, the solution to this exercise is available on the Solutions page under 'Solution 01'.)

Similarly, a car's *registration* is composed of three distinct elements; year (201 for 2020 stage 1), county code (WD for Waterford) and number (1058). __You are required__ to change aCar to reflect this nested structure. Also, add a log statement that displays the following: __Reg. = 201-WD-1058__.

(The solution is on the Solutions page under 'Solution 02'.)

Before continuing, update the git repository as follows:
~~~
$ git add -A
