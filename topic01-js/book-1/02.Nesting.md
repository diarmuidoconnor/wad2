## Nested Objects.

Before attempting the exercise below, first examine the file `dataSamples/04_1_nested_objects.js` from the samples. Run it via Live Server if necessary.

(Re)Start the Live Server from `lab001`.

In `fundamentals.js` the car's *type* property is currently a simple string but structurally it can be broken down into three parts: Make (eg Toyota), Model (eg Corolla), and CC (eg 1.8). __You are required__ to change this property of *aCar* from a string to an object with three properties, namely *make*, *model* and *cc*. To prove your change worked, add the following log statement to the bottom of the file:
~~~
console.log(aCar.owner + ' drives a ' + aCar.type.make)
~~~

![][nested]

(The solution to this exercise is available in the Solutions tab under 'Solution 01'.)

Similarly, a car's *registration* is also composed of three distinct elements; year (201 for 2020 stage 1), county code (WD for Waterford) and number (1058). __You are again required__ to  change aCar to reflect this nested structure. Also add a log statement that displays the following: __Reg. = 201-WD-1058__.

(The solution is in the Solutions tab under 'Solution 02'.)
